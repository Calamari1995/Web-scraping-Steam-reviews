1,EkErilaz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/EkErilaz/,"This is going to go down as a classic that's for sure. The game's historical and geographical accuracy, depth, replayability etc. can be massively extended by mods. Especially for history buffs I recommend Historical Immersion Project which you can get from the Paradox forum (and my submod, Norse Heritage Overhaul, as well as the ""Taxes and Enclosures"" and ""Call to Arms"" tweaks I've made for HIP). I think for many veteran players it is clear that CK3 will struggle to surpass CK2 (especially modded) even in time, due to the different paths it has gone down. It might have a broader appeal, but I see especially some of its features as definite downgrades (e.g. the new way of levying troops, which just summons them to a rally point instead of you having to march them from their county of origin, and the new RP mechanics making people able to ""level up"" characters to choose perks etc. rather than having characters develop naturally, etc.). Unfortunately CK2 is hampered by its DLC policy, and while the base game is now free, many of its important features are locked behind DLCs: Council mechanics, retinues, trade routes, etc. This (along with the game's relatively steep learning curve) makes it very hard for new players to get into the game. That is unfortunate since the game has a lot to offer. I recommend for people to keep an eye out for sales (or Humble Bundle giveaways) and get the most essential DLCs then. My list of essential DLCs for new players: The Reaper's Due --- (prosperity events and diseases) Conclave --- (council mechanics) Horse Lords --- (trade routes, tributaries, and nomads) Way of Life --- (character focus and events) The Old Gods --- (raiding and pagans) The Republic --- (merchant republics) Legacy of Rome --- (retinues) PS. Not really worth it for the price, but also: Monks and Mystics --- (army orders for allies)",Recommended,1544.0,"2,259.7 hrs on record",Posted: 7 June

Players should be aware of this bias as while the game provides a unique social-cultural angle unseen in other titles, it is largely limited to the feudal ruling elite. - There is no way to ""win"" the game outside of a player’s own goals , and the player can only ""lose"" if their character lacks an heir or their last piece of land is taken. - Starting new game as a count, or chief, with only a single province is highly recommended!

(+King+) : Political leader of the country, has multiple duchies at his command. (.-=Emperor=-.) : King of the Kings! It is impossible to play in the role of a peasant, or lesser notables: Baron (castle): Unplayable. The lowest type of feudal lords, with very small meaning. Bishop (temple): Unplayable.

I gave NO for recommendation simple because ALL of their games have a crazy focus on DLC. and DLC's are often even more expensive then the main game. I love DLC's with other games, where you actually get every year for a small amount of money a new experience with the old game. Paradox pricing is ridiculous, it puts you in a hard spot to really really decide if you want to play and love a game, since in the end it will pull money out of your pocket again and again and again (and in a big amount). No, i will not support this. I ask everybody to just expand the ""content for this game"" part and tell me honestly this is perfectly OK . Again, i think they produce high quality games, but their DLC pricing is offensive - i uninstalled all of their games for this reason. i dunno... go play total war series.... or maybe even endless legends... not the same, but i rather give someone else my money. let's boycott this!",Not Recommended,798.0,12.5 hrs on record,Posted: 13 May

My reign so far had been successful, but I had a huge problem, I had no family members left alive after the plague had destroyed my family. I wasn't too bothered; my King was still young and his wife was young too, I had plenty of time left to create an heir to keep the game going. Then one day, my court doctor tells me I have cancer. This is terrible news, I still have no heir and the game will end if the cancer kills me before I can have a child. So I do something very brave: I tell my court doctor to do whatever he has to do to remove the cancer. The operation is a great success, but I find out he has made me a eunuch. He is immediately imprisoned and executed. I no longer have the means to create a child, the great game I was playing seemed like it was about to be all over. But that's when I have the smartest idea of my life I decide to cuck myself . It's a great success, a few years later my wife is suddenly pregnant. Everyone in my court knows that the baby is not mine, even I know its not mine, and my wife surely knows that I'm not the father.

Although my record says I only have 600 something hours that's only on the steam platform. If i combined all my total play time its probably somewhere close to 2000. I first started playing CK2 back in high-school(probably freshman or sophomore year) an boy do I gotta tell you. This game is the absolute its absolute best when you have all the DLC(that you either procured legally or through other-means). It's trully one of the best and purest forms of re-playable entertainment. There are tons of potential combinations that could spring up in just one play through. Even then if you ever get bored of base CK2, there are tons of fun mods to reinvigorate your love. My personal favorites are  After the End, Witcher Kings, Elder Kings, and When the World stopped Making sense. The modding community for the game just like for most paradox games is unrivaled when it comes to creativity. (Side Note: my favorite mod ever for any paradox game is Imperium Universalis for EUIV, it is truly a shame that Imperator: Rome is worse than that.) Disclaimer: If you want to play this game the way it was intended you NEED to have all the DLC(at lease the game mechanic ones cosmetics are cool but not necessary) This is my biggest gripe about paradox games that they seem to be trying to address through the subscription service. Right now the game is free to play but if you want to own all the DLC it could cost you literal hundreds of dollars. So my advice, try out the subscription service, if you like what you see keep going.

Otherwise, I wouldn't have spent over 500 hours playing it. Why do I not recommend it then? Because of Paradox. Possibly the avaricious game studio ever. I bought every single major DLC (I refuse to buy unit packs or music packs, simply unnecessary). I didn't like every DLC I bought, sometimes they added features or content that I didn't like (or sometimes didn't add enough), but I wanted to support and encourage Paradox to continue to develop the game. I knowingly contributed to their greedy attitude. $15-$20 DLCs are outrageous, especially after you make your game free to play. That itself is a betrayal. Is any other Paradox game free to play now? The first Crusader Kings is still $10 on Steam. Why did you make this one free? Why did you make Crusader Kings 3 anyway? There was no reason to make another game. Paradox still pops out major DLCs for EU4, and it runs on the same engine, and it is similar in age to CK2. Then, around a year later, when they realized a money-making machine suddenly stopped making them money, and they alienated part of their fanbase by making a new game, they somehow thought that adding a SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE to a DEAD, SINGLE-PLAYER GAME was a good idea? It's rubbing salt in the wound. Hopefully some other company starts making quality grand-strategy games and will dethrone Paradox.

Your choices affect how easy or hard that progression is and may ultimately ruin you. You can only lose the game by running out of family, and with that loss the ability to rule. Graphically this game is dull; the entirety of it is basically staring at a map. Occasionally one moves characters or armies around and those entities interact with others with minimal animations. But one doesn't play CK2 for the artwork. One plays CK2 for the stories of these rulers. One also should find joy in experimenting with questionable choices and wild curve balls with the understanding that at any moment it may go horribly wrong. I think I prefer CK2 to Europa Universalis 4. Both are produced by the same company, have similar mechanics and one can cross one's game over into that universe if desired. Thus far EU4 has better co-op play because alliances seem to require family relations and marriages aren't always available. EU4 has a broader world to work with and its DLCs are more compelling in that they substantially change the way the game plays. I don't find that to be the case with CK2. Even so, CK2 is still a better game. Here's why: The stories are better. Plain and simple, attaching my actions to simulated royalty instead of a simulated empire makes the game much more enjoyable. I told my buddy about a play through during which I lost a war, went madly in debt, lost my king, had my child king killed by his aunt (she literally had someone push him out of a boat) and had that aunt - a power hungry nut job - lead the empire into a position of power. That narrative simply cannot be duplicated in EU4. I look forward to trying CK3 at some point but I haven't yet fully explored this title. This title is free to play; there's no expense to try it out.

Multiplayer is amazing and I highly suggest it since single player gets rather boring and easy! Now to get to the reason that the game is not recommended. CK2 is a free to play game with over $200.00 worth of DLC. Now normally that would not be an issue since you can piece together what you want. On top of that they offer a subscription service which is $5 a month. Basically it makes for an awesome demo experience to see what you like and don't like. In the long term though you end up paying for dlc's that you are really not getting. It's a ""newer"" cash grab concept to milk the players for money without giving anything, except a demo, in return. Soon as you run out of cash you do not have any of the dlc's and are stuck with the base game until you wait for dlc's to go on sale or buy them outright.

CK3 is a really good game.   It wasn't released in the same bare boned DLC hell fashion like all their prior releases (Stellaris, EU4, HOI4, and I:R).  However, instead of just riding on their success, they decided to engage in pure greed with their subscription policy for CK2.  Hence, they shot their own foot off. First, CK2 is the definition of DLC Hell.  All the DLC's added together for an 8 year old game is insanely high.  So, instead of doing the smart thing and lowering the prices or creating a overall bundle that is cheaper than currently buying all the DLC's, they decided on a subscription model.  This does two things: 1) It alienates people who have already bought some of the DLC's but can't afford the rest, so they are getting far less value in this subscription than someone who has never bought a single DLC for this game.  That's terrible, but #2 is far worse... 2)  It shows potential customers that they shouldn't buy Paradox's games & DLC because Paradox could just do a subscription model instead, which is cheaper overall.  That's a death knell to a company's immediate profits. Paradox's greed has hit rank S and is even greater than EA's.

74,76561198997869502,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198997869502/,"I have spent many hours playing Crusader Kings 2. The ability to go from a duke, to count, king and then emperor, makes for a fantastic role playing experience that feels fresh every time I play. However, many elements of the game are flawed, and begin to crumble apart as you start playing. If you decide to play a very long game and you own the Charlemagne DLC, you might be encouraged to play the 769 start date. The problem, however, is that due to a poor AI that is unable to adapt to issues of succession, the map will degrade itself by way of massive kingdoms splitting up into small counts and duchies. If a player does not take an active role in unifying the region, then the map will be a mess for the entirety of the game and the Islamic religion will control all of Western Europe, it’s ridiculous. In between the moments of expanding your realm, there’s nothing to do that isn’t monotonous and repetitive. You can join a secret society, but it’s either missions filled with improving your piety (Religious Orders) or just killing random people of your own society (Satanic Order). Speaking of the Satanic Order, the initiation ceremony is always the same, and you’re either asked to desecrate a local temple or kill some random member of the society, because for some reason you apparently hate them. Once your character, who is a member of a secret society, dies, than there’s no point in doing it again because you’ve already seen it all. You may also interact with your vassals, but it’s such an archaic system that forces the player to do nothing but to click boxes, and hope that the AI will like you enough not to start a civil war. And if there is a civil war, it’s always about implementing Gavelkind succession, meaning that there never seems to be much reasoning behind the civil wars in the first place, other than forcing the player to interact with their vassals. The game also puts penalties if you go over the vassal and demense limits, but there are so many layers piled on top of one another that you can’t give certain lands to particular characters, and you’re forced to have heavy penalties as a result; this can become exceedingly worse once you gain the title of emperor. You may also get notifications that character x wants to kill character y, but at the end of the day it becomes a question of “Why should I care?”. There is no reason to interact with neighbours unless they are looking to invade you, or vice versa. You will get constant stupid proposals for non-agression pacts from leaders located halfway across the map, and alliances are extremely rare due to the AI’s reluctance. The Coronation Ceremony is just a gimmick that gives very little positive opinion to your character, and there’s no point in interacting with the Pope unless you are interested in starting a crusade. And considering how weak the Catholic religion is in earlier starting dates, it’s possible that you’ll never have enough combined strength to begin the crusade, which means that one of the most interesting parts of the game is already wasted. There will be diseases that pop up throughout the map during the game, but all it means is that you have to “close gates” every 5 minutes and wait it out. Even then, if you have a level 4 hospital in your capital, you never have to worry about disease because it’s so easy to cheese the system. The legendary Black Plague as well can easily be circumvented by just “closing the gates”, there’s no level of urgency. There are no differences between characters in the Indian subcontinent and those in the British Isles, and it’s the same events with just different flavour text. You can make the argument that the Mongols and Chinese make the Eastern part of the map more interesting, but the truth is that both of these empires go through the “blob treatment”, and therefore collapse after 10 years of in-game time. The game’s appeal is that it gives the player the option to create their own story, but what this means is that there’s no late game goal. Want to create an empire? Congrats, you did it! You might as well quit the game now, because there’s nothing left to do. And that summarizes the game in its entirety, you achieved the highest rank possible, and now you have absolutely nothing left to do.

You may then turn to breeding, setting your sights on creating an incredible character seemingly blessed by the gods. This too is fun, though only for so long. In my opinion, the best way to play CK2 is as an RPG. Look at the character your playing as, see what their traits and characteristics are, and from that figure out what their goals and aspirations are. A character with the ambitious trait may aspire to the map painting so typically easy to achieve in this game, but a content character may not wish to ever even leave the borders of their own demesne. I have found in my time with this game, that this role play approach is much more enjoyable and offers much more replayability. 10/10 would inbreed again.

HOI3 is too complex and hard while I just lost any motivation in getting into CK2. The medieval setting could have been interesting if it had been more like EU4 where you get claims more easily and the game isn't as obsessed with titles and ""legitimate"" claims. Hold onto your butts because there are a lot of them. If you have not been a staunch republican before playing the game, you will be after CK2. You have to appease the most privileged kings, princes, princesses, dukes and barons and handle them in all kinds of mechanics that you will be dreaming about the French Revolution, eating baguettes and speaking French. Ça Ira! If you like the thought of role-playing strategy, Crusader Kings 2 is one of the better ones out there. You can get many random events and many of them are wittily written. On marketing and financial matters, Paradox has made the base game free, but many of the game's content is hidden behind the dlc paywall. Without a sale it costs several hundreds of squids to get the full game for a game that came out in 2012. So instead of making their old dlcs cheaper, they decided to offer a 5 squid per month subscription for a game that doesn't get new updates and has desync issues in multiplayer mode. I think subscriptions are a slippery slope and many companies will probably take advantage of at the cost of their customers. Paradox are also adding launchers to their modern games that are much worse than what they had before and I don't like seeing ads for dlcs or other Paradox games in-game when I bought the base game. I can't say I'm delighted of the direction Paradox is taking. Overall I don't recommend CK2. The only thing special about it is the role-playing strategy aspect of the game.

117,jakobfel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jakobfel/,"Product received for free I'm new-ish to grand strategy games and even 4X, starting with Stellaris and Civ 3 before expanding into others (Endless Space, Age of Wonders, EU and some other Paradox games, etc). As such, while I've come to grasp 4X almost entirely, grand strategy still typically overwhelms me for some reason. I'm still rather terrible at EU, Imperator: Rome and the others but Crusader Kings is one series of grand strategy that gripped me almost immediately (though I'm still not good at it). This is probably because, as a huge RPG nerd, I love when RPG freedom is intertwined with other games. Crusader Kings 2 is as much of a large-scale political RPG as it is a grand strategy title. You get to take on the role of the leader of your territory (whether a lesser noble or a high king) and make decisions for your kingdom. Where other grand strategy games typically put you in a sort of ""overseer"" role (seeing everything from your perspective), CK2 puts you in the shoes of a ruler and you are the one who chooses how they behave. What this does is that it creates a special bond between the player and their territory. I've heard Europa Universalis compared to a computerized version of RISK and I don't disagree because that shows the difference between EU and CK. CK is a strategic RPG while EU is a highly advanced, computerized board game. Don't take that as me dissing on EU, though, as it's a great game too. The reason I said that is because of how different the two games are. You still manage the affairs of your kingdom but ultimately, your character and your dynasty are the most important parts of this game. The goal isn't necessarily to make sure you're some political, economic and/or military superpower. The goal is to ensure you have a strong, prestigious dynasty and to do that, you need to be strategic in how you manage your kingdom and your court. This means that you have the opportunity to choose how your character interacts with other characters. It's a medieval political sim in many ways. If you're not careful, you can make enemies with the Pope or powerful monarchs across Europe. You can screw up your dynasty by inbreeding (accidental or intentional). You can choose to be an isolated state that minds its own business or you can butt into everyone else's affairs. The choice is entirely yours. That's what really makes CK appeal to me: it's a medieval strategy sandbox. You set your own goals, you choose how your dynasty interacts with other nations, dynasties and factions. If you don't take care to keep your vassals pleased, you lose power and may even lose your throne, but keeping them pleased may make members of your family or other dynasties angry with you. If you strategically appoint officials in your court and are tactful in your interactions with others, you will have a much smoother experience; as in real life, you cannot do it all on your own, even if you try (and you certainly CAN try). While DLCs and expansions add loads of other features, the base game is still a lot of fun; I don't have any of the expansions yet I still find this game to be a blast; it's one of those games where I lose hours before I realize that I've been playing obsessively. If not for the fact that I have a billion other games I'm trying to finish, I would have absolutely sunk hundreds of hours into this game. The main reason I haven't is because I know how easy it is to end up addicted to it and I don't have the time for yet another addiction! So yes, even if this game were still paid, I'd recommend it. However, since it's free, you have absolutely nothing to lose but some time and when you do lose that time, you won't regret it. CK3 improves on just about every aspect of this game but given its relatively hefty price tag, this game is a great way to at least get the general feel for the franchise. If you enjoy this, you'll almost certainly enjoy 3 but that's not to say CK2 isn't still worth playing, because it is. The sheer amount of expansions to buy can be very overwhelming but like I said, I don't have any of them and I don't feel like I'm playing an unfinished game. Just play it. If you like RPGs and/or grand strategy (or 4X), this is a beautiful blend of those genres and it's a total blast to play.

136,76561198169484173,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198169484173/,"As my time invested would show, I rather enjoy this game, and as a side note, its sequel is rather promising to me. A niche genre for some, but if you enjoy the genre, you'll probably like the game. I played the game for somewhere around 500-700 hours before seriously investing in the DLC, mostly in the AGOT (A Game Of Thrones) mod, so while the DLC provide a lot of content, mods can more than make up the difference if you don't want to shell out a rather hefty sum. My advice is if you are on the fence about it, the base game and mods are completely free. If you enjoy the game in its free form, you can consider if you want to pay for the DLC features, of which there are quite a lot, and subsequently the price tag for the full game is rather high, around $200-300, depending on if you get package deals or sales; prices can vary. If you just want to get a taste of the DLC features, the subscription feature seems nice, if you just want a taste of it. If you pay for more than just a few months though, you start having to pay a lot more than if you just bought a few DLC outright. For example, if you pay for the subscription for just over 5 years, roughly 62 months, you will have paid as much in the subscription as if you paid for all DLCs, but once that month runs out, you once again have nothing. That being said, if you want to play the full experience for just a couple of months, or only occasionally, or want to try the full features before investing $300, the DLC subscription is a great deal. Full disclosure, I have paid for all major content DLC, and you can see my total hours played. You can really get a lot of enjoyment for the price tag, I personally think that the amount I paid is worth it, as of the time of writing it, the game has cost me roughly $0.14 per hour played, which is a better deal than a lot of other entertainment options, but once again, you have to really like the genre to invest that amount of time in a game, so it's not the best option for people who don't love the genre to invest heavily into the game.",Recommended,1653.0,"2,104.6 hrs on record",Posted: 20 April

Other wise its a awesome game even just the free part is awesome. Although it is a bit complicated and the tutorial sucks. I like choosing  a small county by a bigger one and then just swearing fealty and no one can declare war on u or they would have to fight the whole kinddom. I tried it with georgia and swore fealty to the byzantine empire and I grew to almost the whole size of the byzantine empire it self. There is one way if u just wanna see how big u can become just choose a small kingdom by a big one and swear fealty save the game exit then go back click load game then choose the same save but dont click play chose another kindom by the one u swore fealty to. Then just keep doing that I got to where the holy roman empire took over almost all of england and france tryed to do it with the byzantine empire but they were at war.

The one knock that I have is the sales model that Paradox uses (with all of their games in addition to this one). You basically do not really have the full game experience unless you have many (or all) of the zillions of DLC for it. As much as I love this game, I am tempted to down-vote it in protest because I find this sales strategy so dishonest. It's basically false advertising as they are not disclosing up front the true cost of the full game experience.

I have played for a 100 hours and i havent even touched the byzantine or the holy roman empire or playing as a nomad, let alone massive conversion mods like after the end, a game of thrones, or the skyrim or WoW ones. There is simply so much to do in this game. there are so many scenarios and possibilites, But, you will need dlc to play any nation that isnt christian (paradoox is pretty greedy). For dlc, i highly reccomend The Old Gods, which lets you play as pagan rulers in the north and Africa. I can also reccommend the dlc subscription service. For $5 a month you get access to all dlc, worth about $300 dollars (you dont need all dlc, most is just content packs though).

You will realise the game itself is not very complex - but you'll soon find it's about all the mad stories that you will make along the way; whether it be satanic, tyrannical, inbred, or all three plus more. Great with friends, only the host needs the DLC for you to play with them which is a big bonus. However, some of the DLC, such as customising your ruler, is stupid to be behind a paywall - but cannot argue with a free game I suppose. Oh yeah speaking of, CK2 is free!

256,SgtGala-vine,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SgtGala-vine/,"While some of the games story telling is quite good unless you really have a thing for crusades its not all that.. certainly a good dynasty simulator but no way as good as the Civilization series.. Also they have borked the history in so many places, including Cornwall which has over 5000 years worth of history, where for some reason it has 'Breton' culture and not Cornish culture and in the time period 936ad is for some reason not a kingdom but a dukedom which happened much later in history. paradox games argument is as below. ""I'm sure the rulers of Cornwall at one time called themselves ""kings"", but this was in an era where many, many independent rulers had the same title. In game terms, these people would be much better represented as Dukes or even Counts. The ""Kingdom of the Isles"" is one example in-game of a ""kingdom"" that really doesn't deserve to be represented as such in the game. Cornwall would be another. Kingdoms in the game (with a few historical exceptions such as Navarra and Galicia) countain multiple duchies, and would be a respectable power compared to othe kingdoms if they controlled all their de jure land. Cornwall would defiitely not be on par with England or Bohemia or even Wales or Brittany."" - neondt 'content designer' Cornwall is totally on par with Wales and England back then.. this guy knows about as much about Cornish (celtic history) as I do about programming content for games.. ♥♥♥♥ all!.. I recently downloaded the historical immersion project mod and its even worst demoting Cornwall to a 'chiefdom' in the same time period...

Many of their customers have already spent $100+ on DLC, and it feels like a slap in the face to all the players who have already had this game for years. I would've signed up for the service in a heartbeat if it came out a few years ago... That being said, this game has a steep learning curve but is extremely fun once you get the hang of it, especially if you are interested in this period of history. There are many playable characters that actually existed which adds a great element of role-play, if that's your thing. HOWEVER, the DLC is basically required in order to get the full experience. I'd recommend playing the base game with no DLC first, and if you enjoy that, start looking into the DLC and purchase whichever ones interest you. This game's one major downfall is the DLC structure, which Paradox is known for and seems to be doubling down on with every game they release. It's a real shame that they have made it the norm to release bare bones games and add hundreds of dollars of DLC in order to complete the game.",Not Recommended,928.0,388.1 hrs on record,Posted: 10 June

In reality it is trying to deal with spamming event screens designed to kill your charecter or make accomplishing anything impossible. As an example, I started one game a couple weeks ago.  Started out as a Duke, since the time before I was an independent count and conquered by a Duke within a month (being a vassal is no fun).  Took the hunting focus with 'make a friend' ambition.

I have a few random DLC that I bought on sale over the years.  Mostly regret it, watching any ""let's plays"" on You Tube and they all have DLC I don't have.  I won't buy it, it's insanely overpriced for a game that's been superseded by CKIII already. In terms of the game itself, I want to like it and maybe it's me, but I feel Paradox has done a poor job of presenting the complex information available in the game.   The interface and presentation of the information you need to manage your empire is obscured by bad design decisions that despite selling a lot of DLC they've never bothered to fix. Instead, they go release CKIII and no doubt plan to start charging people all over again for what's a remake of the same game.",Not Recommended,645.0,202.2 hrs on record,Posted: 7 March

And it's $4..... which wouldn't be bad if all the other dlc required to make the game complete wasn't so expensive.

Playing an Earl is a waste of time unless you want to put the game on fast forward and see world events play out.  You can't actually do anything apart from maybe attack your Duke at which point you get stomped. Playing a King feels like being in a government who privatised and now is held to ransom by unions you can't get rid of. The whole game is an annoyance of trying to meet criteria in order to do anything which either takes an age or once you do achieve it there is no pay off as it does not affect anything. In one game England got invaded and the King did nothing, I could not partition him to act or make alliances with others to raise a defence.  I could not partition the attacker to stop or even join them.  Spent the whole game waiting to be taken over. You can rarely every assassinate or plot to kill any enemies as either it takes far too long or you can rarely get enough support.  You cannot do anything to free capture relatives, I can't invade the county that has them or offer the liege money to set them free. Money is hard to come by, building and tech are a waste of time. If you like watching different scenarios of history play out then you might like this game.  If you want war, battles, building empires then it's not.

I played as the Byzantine and defeated Bulgaria and got the counties from the Black Sea. Game recommends I make claims against the Bulgarians again but I decide to be a nice guy and respect the truce. I then see one of my new counts is plotting against me and doesn't like me. So I try to get him out of my newly conquered lands: obviously he protests so he then starts a rebelion .... which many of my ""loyal"" vassals join and somehow they put up an army bigger than anything I could've mustered myself, So then 3 armies from what I've seen, of over 10k are roaming my lands. I defeat one cause my Scholae and Varingians are better and I would've been angry if I lost even if outnumbered. The sheer number of enemies tho was overwhelming and obviously they were conquering very fast too, unlike when I CONQUERED. Then my leader dies and I resume out of this war, with a ""loyal"" guy commanding my empire now, while my loser son has my lands and the few counties assigned to him. Basically my potential army size was reduced to 3k. What a stupid game. Many of you will say oh well you aren't good at politics and bla bla bla. ♥♥♥♥ that. Game is stupid, doesn't show your options properly. Prices for useless stuff is way too high while you barely make 25 gold when not at war. Oh look I can build those church walls for 300g so that my useless church defenses last 2 days longer. No, it's just bad. I keep trying games like these and they are just mind-numbingly bad. You have 2000 archers vs 200 archers, the volley part of the game makes you lose more numbers than them lmao. You can't really control your army so basically if something goes wrong or you play the wrong difficulty, oups, your elite troops die to some light armor peasant infantry. It was going well militarily but the politics and diplomacy and creating claims is so bad and slow and doesn't work. I had 3 big rebellions while everyone was happy in a region. 3 times I had to put them down. And not to mention if I didn't act fast they would suddenly get 10000 troops somehow. If you want a mind-numbing boring tedious ""strategy"" game where you are limited at every step but your enemies can just levy troops and hold wars for an eternity at no penalty, then this is the game for you. Paradox makes the worst strategy games where elite troops like Varingians and Scholae in this game, lose to THE SAME ARMY YOU RECRUIT AS LEVY FROM THOSE TRAITORS, or like how in Hearts of Iron you rush making better tanks just to lose to some low quality French troops. Not to mention their marketing schemes to make you pay 1000$ for one game with 30 DLC that could've been easily made into 3 large DLC for less money.

Seriously? Great way to keep the people who were constantly discriminated against by these EUROCENTRIC societies - forced to live in REAL LIFE POVERTY - from having a shred of escapism from it all.  Not only does Paradox OVERVALUE DLC in the realm of HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS for a SINGLE GAME, but now they laugh in the face of the underprivileged and rub their own privilege in the face of minorities who face a hostile world - THEY MAKE YOU PAY A SUBSCRIPTION FEE FOR CONTENT YOU DON'T EVEN GET TO KEEP. DLC AS A RENTAL. So now, Paradox is bringing one of the most despicable parts of capitalism into the gaming industry.  You're literally being  taken back fifteen years in history to where you have to RENT your game to enjoy it -  EUROCENTRIC and RACIST as it might be. Rent is an institution fueled by hate, abuse, and the treatment of human beings as livestock.  Now, they're putting it down as their favored game format.  Tencent - if they at all want to represent the progress proposed by the People's Republic of China - should DUMP Paradox Interactive. As someone who has been personally hurt by such far-right policies (celebration of Hitler as the most important ""leader"" in Hearts of Iron IV, watering down cultures and entire races as ""inferior"" as part of game mechanics, and an outright rejection of effort to make African societies in any way ""noble"" beyond simple token existence) Paradox has always had a problem where they LEAP to white-only gaming and racial discrimination against everyone else, price-points just being one part of their systemic Corporate racism. What once seemed to be ""Eurocentrism"" has come into full focus as time has gone on.  Post after post glorifying European culture and history - despite how brutal, perverse, and downright mean people were in those days was just the tip of the iceberg.  They have a battalion of rabid Right-Wing extremist fans, now showing themselves even here to insult and harass me for speaking out, and these people show you how backwards they are with their regular insults. The truth is that outside of the European and Indo-Aryan cultures, this game is frankly white-centric supremacist propaganda.  Africa has NO detail (and they have had more than enough opportunity to ""SELL"" that detail).  Black characters are not treated with unique love and admiration as the white kings are, and one of the richest men in African and frankly, WORLD history - Mansa Musa - is barely depicted as a footnote in by this overwhelmingly Eurocentric extremist company. If Genocide of races and racist game mods are tolerated in Stellaris, and if mass-murder and outright cultural discrimination and celebrated - even encouraged - colonization of ""inferior"" cultures are a staple of games like Europa Universalis (itself Universal Europe - the raw definition of white supremacy) then WHAT, dare say, does a game like CKII offer? ZERO beauty from race mixing.  ZERO celebration of diversity.  Just carbon copy, after carbon copy, of predominantly white superiors 'owning' people in shades of brown; not historically accurate in the slightest.  Some might want to make the argument that Asian cultures are overpowered, but let's be real - they're tokens, just like the Aztec Invasion DLC is a cheap shot at false representation for Latin American peoples of mixed ancestry. In short?  This game was designed by racists, for racists.  It is absolutely despicable the lack of effort put into making African nations a playable, fun atmosphere, and the lack of effort to make them anything more than a token feature to be colonized by the Europeans to the north. And now, yet another feature by Paradox to discriminate against people of color and those stricken with poverty has arisen.",Not Recommended,3279.0,265.1 hrs on record,Posted: 20 February

Like all other Paradox games it heavily suffers from devious business practices, but that doesn't stop it from being exceptional. There are quite a few inadequacies about the game's UI that make the vanilla game much worse than it should be, but the very active modding community will allow you to fix most of the problems away really. A minor inconvenience, but stupid one anyway is how Paradox keeps locking achievements away under the exceedingly harsh prerequisites of playing a vanilla, ironman game in all of their releases. Let it be clear once and for all: I will never play a Paradox game vanilla, and I will never play a Paradox game in ironman. Why make your game moddable if you're going to spit on your player base for modding it? I just don't get it. It's not very important, but it's definitely a bit of a shame because achievements serve as very good pretexts in this game to try out new civilizations or gameplay mechanics.

It has great depth and storytelling with complex by predictable systems. But, it will feel arbitrary like just a convoluted game of dice to most players because of all the problems with Paradox's development style. The game has 16 expansions released over the course of 6 years and dozens of lesser DLCs, which is actually a good thing, but doing it well requires some details that paradox horribly misses. Each DLC came with an update to the base game, and not just a little more content, core systems changed to accommodate new features, but very little of the in game documentation got updated to reflect those changes. Do not trust tutorial dialog. Moreover, Paradox does not maintain out of game documentation at all, and thus 90% of what you find is riddled with information that is horribly wrong. A game that has enough content such that half of context menu options have to be hidden entirely when not usable to keep the menus usable, cannot give a good user experience to a new player or a player returning after a very long time if not even the ""official"" wiki can be expected to be up to date on some of the most basic features (like how non-aggression pacts are created in a game fundamentally about diplomacy).",Not Recommended,1065.0,182.1 hrs on record,Posted: 25 July

Additionally, my impression was that at that time, shortly after the launch of Crusader Kings III, Crusader Kings II had a greater variety in story prompts.

As it stands, the game feels downright unfinished without the expansions, and Paradox decided to take possibly the scummiest approach to selling them by making it a subscription. I cannot stress enough just how ridiculous it is that they implemented a subscription service into a nearly decade old game that now has a sequel. To make matters worse, the sequel has a lot of content from the biggest expansions already implemented, which makes the subscription even less valuable. But maybe I'm getting off topic. This is a review for the base game, not the subscription. But frankly, the game is barely worth playing in my eyes without the dlc. So many parts of the game are literally unplayable without them, and by literally I do mean literally. You cannot play as certain countries or leaders without the corresponding dlc, so if you want to play the full game you're either going to have to spend around two hundred dollars to own everything, or shell out five bucks a month to essentially rent it. This whole game has just become a disappointment to me. I'm disappointed in the lackluster gameplay, I'm disappointed in the developers for creating this whole mess, and I'm disappointed in my self for actually spending money on it.

While I am aware of their DLC subscription service, I would argue that the implementation of such a system speaks to the larger problem. That said, CK2 is a game in which you can create and manage a level of inter-dynastic incest that the Habsburgs would find revolting, and commit horrid crimes against God and Nature, and still be named saint by the church. Meanwhile your sister comes into possession of the Necronomicon, and as King Dievas of Finland, you must have the tome for yourself and you kill your sister. If you like stories, and don't mind paying a papal tithe for at least all the major expansions, I would say go for it. Alternatively, if you plan on playing with friends, convince one of them to acquire the DLC and have them host, since in multiplayer, everyone operates off the host's content.",Not Recommended,881.0,411.7 hrs on record,Posted: 9 July

Your job is to keep your family line going, and when you no longer have a heir or family member to play as its game over. Esentially staving off death and making babies is the obvious goal, but behind that is what makes this game great. CK2 manages to chokehold the RPG formula far better than Paradox's other games have since, resulting in some of the most memorable stories you may have in a game. The complexity of CK2's environment and the npc's clashing leads to limitless hours of possible content, or a 10 minute game where your character went out boar hunting, stubbed his toe, and died from dysentery. Anything is on the table and anything will inevitably happen. That being said, CK2 is still a fairly easy game to get into and most of the tutorial is simply playing it and finding out what each button does, despite the very overwhelming UI. The DLC altogether can be a bit expensive outside of sales, so I'd recommend getting a key elsewhere or on the subscription service thingy.

Some people say they come from England, and England is inside Britain, but if that was the case they would be British they would be Englanders. Also, heard some silly theories about them coming from whales. Guys, no, whale people do not exist. Whales live in the sea. There is a consensus on british people coming from Europe, but then we are left with a whole continent of possible locations. That's as good as nothing. What do they eat? Every country has at least one main dish. Even the US has their burgers. But these british people, what do they eat? Heard some people associating them with tea, but everyone knows that's an Asian thing. Shouldn't they come from Europe? One of these two points must be wrong them. To me, it looks too sketchy. What language do they speak? I challenge you, putting all my money and my ass on the line here, to find a supposed """"british"""" person speaking their native language. Most of then just speak a broken ENGLISH. Yes, english. Really suspicious, huh? And I even tried to look deeper into it.

Rating: 7/10 CK2 is a great game. It's not perfect, but it has a wealth of content and much like most Paradox grand strategy games, great replayability. It focuses more on building your own dynasty and fame for yourself, rather than simply bulding the biggest empire - although that is certainly a valid way to go about it. Unfortunately, it is a bit limited in the roleplaying aspect by a rather limited interactions system, and by over-reliance on randomized events. While it is a lot of fun, at times, you feel like playing a slot-machine - and you, of course, lose more often than win. Considering the rest of the game suffered from this focus on interaction and events and is therefore a bit more simplistic than the other Paradox GS type games, it can be a bit shallow and frustrating to deal with at times. Still, it is a great window into the life of a medieval ruler, and if you like this type of games, you will easily sink hundreds of hours into it, and it is still one of the best games to roleplay in Multiplayer, where the game really shines, as you can get an actual conversation with your adversaries and allies instead of the limited interactions menu. However, even in singleplayer, the game can still be a lot of fun. The graphics are passable, given the age of the game, and the genre. Music is pretty good, ambience is as well, but some of it will become annoying pretty quickly and the ability to manage sound types and volumes is a bit limited, the game could use expanded options for audio instead of the very simple ones it has. Also, I would recommend getting at least the DLCs that expand the roleplaying aspects, such as Conclave, but I cannot recommend the game and DLCs at full price - if you are interested, definitely wait for a discount campaign, they happen often enough.",Recommended,1629.0,624.4 hrs on record,Posted: 5 June

The point is to play best you can and rack up as many points as you can, before you lose.

Most songs are okay if you prefer the AOE type background music but some of the other songs like the viking metal kinda take me away from the feel of the game. other than that i wish there was more ways to interact with the other characters like prohibiting certain vassals from fighting while large military operations are happening like crusades or jihads. Maybe if they also added a way for you to pull out of a war if an alliance is broken due to marital ties or a way to back out of a war. If not then a way to enforce demands or to surrender as a secondary party involved in a war, i.e. If the 2 main parties involved in a war are not able to actually fight the war due to other wars or infighting, the allies that are drawn into the war can either mitigate and offer a white peace or if one of the allies has been defeated they can offer their terms of surrender.

Minus DLCS For a game that is free on steam I'd say this is a must get. If you like strategy games with an RPG element then this is the game for you. However, the one thing the game does miss is not having comprehensive battles like the total war series does. So if that is something you want then this game might not be for you. That being said, the depth and scope of the game is something to admire. From Count to Duke to King to Emperor. Western Cultures, Middle East and more. There is a little something for everyone here. I've had more fun being a lowly count or Duke then I have had as a King because at times it can feel too much but that is part of the charm. Seeing my Duke rise to King of England and then King of England and Scotland. To his Grand daughter losing both crowns and even my home county.

There are lots of others on-line. Clearly this makes the less realistic and challenging but can enable you to take the game on once you have played as it should be played and go for a truly massive Empire. My biggest one was the Armenian empire conquering the whole Middle East, North Africa and into Spain and Turkey. I eventually realised I had recreated The Ottomon Empire but as an Armenian Empire which is an interesting twist if you know about that particular combination. I prefer inheritance to one person as otherwise your Empire falls apart every generation, this requires a Feudal government. Also locate next to a different religion as that makes it easier to expand. I would just say many of the extras are optional. I do not really like the different faces/clothes as I prefer consistency but that is just me and it does save lots of money.

1282,papapenquinz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/papapenquinz/,"Hello, hello! Nikolai back with a serious review. If you're wondering whether to invest your time and money into the game (the money isn't necessary now!), then come my friend, we will go on a journey and I will show you the wonders of Paradox's Crusader Kings II. GRAPHICS Oh boy, oh boy. You lookin' for a photorealistic game? This is a strategy game, shoo! No, but actually, the character portraits look good and the UI is custom for certain cultures, so it's a nice touch. GAMEPLAY If you like forging dynasties, plotting assassinations and other shmut like that, then it is for you. Here you can arrange marriages, scheme, manage your own vassals, court and council. Lots of popup choices too, so it's very nice and each game is different and EPIC. It's also very addicting, I once spent 6 hours playing and didn't even notice how I burnt all that time. AUDIO The music, the sound effects are just eargasmic. They immerse you even more and fit the theme really good. AUDIENCE I'd say you should be at least 13 to play this, not because of the content, but because your brain might be too small to handle the game sometimes. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS OS: Win7 64-bit. Processor: Intel® Pentium® IV 2.4 GHz or AMD 3500+ Memory: 4 GB RAM. Hard Disk Space: 2 GB. Video Card: NVIDIA® GeForce 8800 or ATI Radeon® X1900, 512mb graphics memory required. DirectX®: 9.0c. Sound: Direct X-compatible sound card. Additional: 3-button mouse and keyboard. DIFFICULTY This game is easy to learn, but hard to master. Sometimes you need to wiggle your tiny brain to forge strategies and get out of slippery situations. GRIND No grind at all. STORY You forge your own story here, how cool is that?! GAME TIME To infinity and beyond my friend. The opportunities here are endless. PRICE It's free! Get it now, it's free! Of course I recommend buying DLCs, but I will write a guide on that soon enough. BUGS There are some annoying bugs, like vassals backstabbing you out of nowhere or your own son slicing your throat. So, do be careful with all of that. Overall, I love this game. I recommend buying it 10/10.",Recommended,1720.0,14.1 hrs on record,Posted: 19 April

It has everything you could wish for in a grand strategy game. Like most Paradox games it has one hell of a learning curve, but for me that's fantastic. You can play this game for a thousand hours and still learn new things, how cool is that? It also has a dark sense of humor, which is quite befitting for the Middle Ages I guess. Want to get posessed by Lucifer himself, sacrifice dwarfs and marry a horse? Sure, why not. Would you rather go wife-swapping as a Viking, kill the pope and duel your own mother into submission? Just an average day am I right. I do have to talk about the DLC's though. Paradox's DLC policy is probably the second worst in all of Steam (the worst being Train Simulator with over 625 DLC's) Yes, you will have to destroy your life savings account to buy all the DLC because Paradox likes to get their greasy fingers all over your money. Yes, some of these DLC's should be in the base game and Sunset Invasion is basically just a meme. Luckily you can get the Steam keys relatively cheap online for a total of like $50. All in all I can definitely recommend CK2, in my oppinion with all DLC's it's still way better and more challenging than CK3.

I tried other characters in Europe and then it got really hard really fast.  So I put it down and then come back months later, a few times.  Recently I read that Brittany is a good starting point as you have relative safety like Ireland but you're more in the flow of things.

I wish I could tell many stories about this beauty of a game, but for the sake of time I'll tell one in the world of Elder Kings (a fantastic Elder Scrolls mod). I was but an orc boy in a small county to the north west (High Rock for you nerds). My father had died the previous year, a great warrior finally bested in a duel by a rival he had tormented over the years, his enemies took no chances to keep the great man alive. This boy the warrior's son grew in his fathers name. The boy had a mentor, age 65, the same as the one who had once taught his father. He trained and practiced, till one day he grew strong enough to rule, his mentor stood down as regent and sent forth a new era. Once a boy and now a man, he slay the traitor who murdered his father, killed the past, and took his place in the sun. Bolstering his ranks he challenged the might of the Kingdom of Daggerfall in battle, with crushing blows to the enemies flanks he made many sacrifices to the cruel gods that day. Battle after battle and war after war he conquered his enemies, until one day he had achieved his goal, he had conquered all of High Rock and ushered in the Kingdom of Orisinium, a new homeland for all orc-kin. And thus continued his bloodline following his legacy and orsimer tradition each son would challenge his father to combat, the winner would rule and the loser would die. And then the crazy CK2 stuff happened. One son who was quite weak killed his father who was a near indomitable force. That son then ruled and all was well for some 20 years, until he was murdered in cold blood by an assassin. Thus his son took the throne, but that son was quite weak and had no chance either, he too was assassinated. Then the next son, only three years of age, he made it but 6 months before he was assassinated as well. That son's Great-Uncle then ruled Orisinium who was promptly killed in combat. At this point the Orisinium vassals were not very content with the state of affairs at which point they removed by bloodline from the throne and placed a more stable one upon the throne. And thus my great bloodline were but mere dukes and it took many hours of gameplay before I was able to reinstate myself as the true rulers of Ork-Kin.
