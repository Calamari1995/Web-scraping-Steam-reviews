Cons: - steep learning curve - underlying mechanics not easy to understand - tutorial is not sufficient, extensive research has to be done in forums, youtube, reddit to fully grasp the game - AI has flaws (then again every AI has that problem) - PDX DLC policy (hate it or love it, at least they keep providing content. I'm fine with paying 10-20 bucks of a DLC that gives me 50 hours of gameplay) Pros: + very detailed gameplay, multiple aspects of production, warfare and ressource accquisation have to be dealt with + focus trees (even though locked behind DLC paywall) are getting more detailed and immersive + countless gameplay options for many countries provide immense replayability (number with DLCs increasing) + lots of achievements to grind, some fun, some very hard + Coop is fun, as is multiplayer if you have 6 consecutive hours spare",Recommended,799.0,"1,784.8 hrs on record",Posted: 27 February

If we look just at vanilla Hoi4, we can see that this game had so much potential, but executed poorly, even after so many DLCs its still pretty bare bones compared to another thing, which keeps alive this game for a long time. Its mods, mods and mods. There so much mods, so much different types of them, that you feel like youre a small kid in the toystore where all the games and toys are FREE, not only that, but those toys are made by regular people like you and I. Its quite impressive that pretty mediocre game could become 10/10 game just because this one thing. You can spend hours upon hours just trying different mods out. You want something like regular vanilla, but with more conten? Road to 56 got you covered. Maybe you want to play something quite different like, idk, alternative universe. You got boatload of them, one the well-known is Kaiserreich (and a Wacky Kaiserredux, which is waaaaay better and fun, then original, because more stuff the better. Change my mind.) You got also Cold war era mods, mideval  era mods, modern day mods, etc... You also got a unicorn which is sorta Visual novel in form of strategy which is called TNO ( The New Order: Last days of Europe). I mean, you got so much stuff that sometimes you dont know which mod to play. Oh, and there is a huge amout of grafical, sound mods and etc. And yeah, you need to buy some DLCs just to have ac—Åess to some cool mechanics in game. (But of course you can sometimes ""Buy"" them with a pretty big discount (up to 100%) if you know what I mean *wink*wink*. But I don't approve of that. And buy this game only during sales, your wallet will be thankful for that.

32,76561198152397772,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198152397772/,"The amount of time I have used playing this game, truly makes me wonder was it all worth it? Two thousand hours looking at funny maps, moving troops, navies, air wings within it and managing resources. Was there nothing more entertaining in my life, back then when I bought this game? It was fun for maybe like the first thousand hours, but after that, everytime I finished a campaign, I would be extremely exhausted and underwhelmed, half a day practically wasted. Why would man impose such waste of time on oneself, even if he gets little to none happines from it? It must be simply masochism and self hate towards oneself, to repeat the cycle of picking a nation and playing for countless of hours, almost everyday. Was there no better way of using that time, developing useful skills or reading a good book? Despite everything, I still love the game and return to it once in a while. Hell, there's a chance I'm just burned out and I will expend another thousand hours into it (I hope not). Now I could in detail explain what's good and bad about the game, gameplay wise, graphically etc. but I really can't muster the energy to do it properly. So I'll just say that it's one of the better, maybe in the top 3 best grand strategy games ever. The game has also a really active and large modding community, which really keeps the game fresh and gives counter balance to the absurd DLC-policy of Paradox Interactive. But for real, if you want to buy and play the game proper, please don't use thousands of hours to it. For your own well-being and future. And make sure you stop playing when you no longer get, what you originally bought it for, which most likely is to gain enjoyment. I would probaply /not/ recommend this game, due to it in the long run taking so much of my time and for the outrageous DLCs that Paradox sells for this game. But for some reason I can't dislike the game. Thus I give it a score of 8.5/10, my favourite time-waste game ever.",Recommended,1599.0,"2,423.4 hrs on record",Posted: 5 March

42,ukraineball,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ukraineball/,"I feel that the hoi4 development team has strayed away from developing mechanics, and instead being more focused on making some crazy alt history focus tree for some random minor nation. Although they have improved air and naval* systems, and even added espionage* (which feels a little lackluster to be on its own dlc), these changes took like a year each to be changed, and many other features are screwed up (especially peace treaties). Also it feels that hoi4 is more focused on making huge focus trees* that take forever to get through, and have some absolutely bonkers alt history paths (not necessarily a bad thing but they could have focused on other things). Although, the game is good at the thing that it focuses on: warfare. The war mechanic in this game is pretty good and I would only like to see only a few changes to it. But unfortunately, after you play the game for long enough, the AI becomes really easy to beat since it has no idea on what it's doing. Lastly, probably the best thing about this game and the reason why I am recommending it, the mods. I pretty much never play vanilla, thanks to the huge collection of mods that the community makes. Hoi4 is home to giant mods that no other paradox game has. Thus I recommend to get this game as long as you have the intent of using the steam workshop constantly.

53,76561198836575948,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198836575948/,"TLDR: If you love grand strategy, logistics, and encircling maneuvers, as well as a gradual buildup to an epic (albeit slow) war, then this is the best WWII strategy game you can buy. However, this is a game of strategy, not tactics, so keep that in mind. Actual Review: Hearts of Iron 4 is an amazing World War 2 grand strategy game. However, it's definitely not for everyone. There's a distinct lack of action in the early game, as you slowly build up your forces and industrial capability. Furthermore, you kind of have to set your own goals for the game, whether that is allying with one of the three major factions before the outbreak of war, or just conquering your neighbors and avoiding tangling with the big dogs. PROS: --If you love logistics, supply, troop configurations and large-scale movement of divisions, then you will have a blast playing this game. You can design division templates however you wish and there are glorious loads of numbers and interesting statistics to mess with. --The scale of the game is very epic, and you definitely feel like the master of millions of troops slowly pushing long lines of combat. --The interface, albeit a bit clunky in some areas, is efficient and streamlined for the most part. --You can do some absolutely amazing encircling maneuvers and other big strategies. Want to hold chokepoints? You can do it. Want to launch surprise naval landings in the enemy's backyard? Yep, that too. --The soundtrack is about as good as you can get for a World War 2 game. NEUTRAL POINTS: --The game is probably amazing if you play cooperatively or competitively with friends. I wouldn't know as all my friends were not big fans of this and won't play with me any more. See con #1. --There's not much you can do for small-scale tactics or individual battles. This is a game about broad strokes  of army movements and strategies, not minute details of individual battles. Less tactics, more strategy. CONS: --There's a distinct lack of action early on in the game, and the game does feel a bit dry for people who are used to more intense action and combat. This means it won't appeal to everyone, and especially not to people who don't enjoy logistics and strategy over tactics and action. The joy of the war in the game is seeing amazing strategies come to fruition or fail miserably, and, frankly, that's just not enough for some people (such as my friends). --Further elaborating on that point, the combat is very dry. It's basically watching numbers fight each other. You need a good imagination to really enjoy it. --There are long, dry stretches of the game where not a lot happens. This can be alleviated by speeding up the game, but just be prepared for that. You won't be getting constant dopamine hits from this one. --You can technically choose to play any nation in the world (at that time), but obviously there is a strong bias towards the big players of World War 2. If you play any country outside of the axis, allies, or comintern, you will find yourself at a distinct disadvantage that only the greatest level of skill and experience with the game can overcome. This can diminish the fun for many people who might want to conquer the world as the mighty (and tiny) nation of Bhutan. It's not impossible, it's just very, very difficult. --A few cosmetic and small issues that can be fixed with mods (division icons, etc). So, basically, if you are a patient, left-brained person who enjoys logistics and grand army strategies and maneuvers, then you might enjoy this game. But if you want intense action and amazing combat as well as a constant stream of stimulation, then this is probably not the game for you. P.S. - The DLC are a bit overpriced, but not necessary, so I really don't mind it. You might though.",Recommended,3106.0,100.6 hrs on record,Posted: 22 May

However, I highly recommend HOI4 if you plan on using mods or at least get the DLCs. Which are overpriced by a lot, but that is another story. Vanilla HOI4 The base game feels barebone and offers very little when it comes to different playstyles and strategies. Minor nations are designed with the bare minimum and even some major ones have very simple focus trees. Vanilla HOI4 is void of decisions, diverse playstyle options and interesting history progression. Those are the reasons why I cannot recommend the base game. It is an empty shell of a strategy game. DLCs The DLCs introduce mechanics which improve the overall gameplay by quite a bit and open a lot more strategic possibilities. Alternate history is also way more diverse and offers interesting world progression. It makes the game way more challenging and replayable. That being said, they are too expensive for what they offer. And a lot of what they introduce should have already been in the base game. Only consider getting the DLCs if they are on sale. Mods The big positive is the modding community. Mods are the lifeblood of this game. There are countless mods out there for pretty much everything you can imagine. Many of them completely overhaul the game and improve it in every aspect.

117,jaeru,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaeru/,"In classic Paradox fashion, base game isn't the whole experience they are offering. Instead you are supposed to pay around 60-70 dollars for expansions and in total of 165 dollars for all DLC - that is if you are interested in costumes and music packs. Which I most certainly am not. Vanilla is obviously playable, but it isn't that enjoyable to play. Most expansions add (almost) needed changes/fixes and gameplay enhancing focus trees for less major countries, such as Hungary or Portugal. Seriously Man the Guns expansion tweaks naval warfare and actually makes it fun. In base game it is as shallow as it gets - even with rather recent ""redone naval combat"". Now. Why did I recommend this game? Because funnily enough, once you actually have these DLC's, game (un)surprisingly becomes fun. There are plenty of stuff to do. You can play historical focuses ON and play how WW2 was meant to be like (keep in mind, even with historical focuses, there are almost certainly historical inaccuracies). Or alternatively turn historical focuses OFF and enjoy the chaos that will endure. Obviously you can do this in vanilla as well, but expansions add so much flavor into the game - with extra focus trees and more things that you can do - no game is same experience. PLUS if you have rich friends or friends that devote their whole unholy soul to Paradox, you can play multiplayer with them. As every player inherits DLC's from lobby host. That being said, Hearts of Iron IV is easily easiest Paradox grand-strategy game out there. It is very easy to learn and easier to master than games like Europa Universalis IV. There is still enough depth to look forward into and most casual players will still find HOI4 difficult to play. Which makes it fun experience to play with friends. Keep in mind though, like every other Paradox game, it only operates 1 thread from your CPU, so it runs like trash. So even with beast computer, expect FPS drops with faster game speeds. There are other nitpicks I could say, such as terrible new launcher they forced last year. However IF HEARTS OF IRON IV IS ON SALE, it is definitely worth a try. Don't expect too much though, as Paradox's quality control has been in deep decline since release of Stellaris.",Recommended,1848.0,338.0 hrs on record,Posted: 22 June

For example many of the dlcs are required to have a fun and enjoyable experience, however you can play with all if them if you a join a multiplayer game with all dlcs. For example, the newest dlc ""Battle for the Bosporus"" only adds focus trees, no new game mechanics, so that dlc would not be required as you could get the same experience with mods, but the dlc ""Together for Victory"" adds some very important game mechanics. There is a very huge and amazing modding community for hoi4, just scroll through the steam workshop and you will see some absolutely amazing mods, just to list a few there is Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Old World Blues, and Road to 56. Now multiplayer, a very diverse and interesting thing in HOI4. I would recommend if you want to get into multiplayer, find a good group of people to play with that are fun and chill, because be warned, there are many multiplayer groups out their who are just nazis who just act retarded and just spam the n word and things of that nature. The majority of communities and people who play this game aren't like that, but there is definitely a good chunk of players who are like that. Singleplayer, the bane of any HOI4 player. Singleplayer can be alright early on when you don't really know how the game works or how to beat the ai, but once you know how to do those things you won't want to play singleplayer, because it becomes extremely easy, and please I warn you, don't buy this game to do achievements. I have only done a few and many of the ones I have not done are extremely difficult and just not fun. Just look up youtube videos of people attempting them and look how it long it takes them and how not enjoyable it is. So this wasn't a super in depth review but to be honest I would recommend this game for anyone who either likes Paradox games, or enjoys WW2/Strategy Games since you will probably suck thousands of hours into it just like I have. Also, if you are debating about buying this game, make sure to watch youtube videos that are reviews and tutorials just to really see if you enjoy it.

As for together for victory, as annoying as it is that it is DLC, I'll push past and give the content a reluctant 7/10, I think that you should be able to increase puppet autonomy is one flaw. I think they did a good job with some focus trees and one of my favourites is New Zealand. This being said(my opinion), I think an option to have the focus of the puppet to be more aggressive, or if not, I think the puppet AI should be more aggressive than it is rn. What do I recommend? Countries: Germany, it's just a nice all around country where you can be incredibly overpowered given it's focus tree can get you austria, czechoslovakia, yugoslavia, and potentially some polish lands as well as puppeting greece, romania, and hungary without war.. Soviet union, need I say more? Ok I do apparently, tons of manpower, tons of resources, tons of troops, germany might blitzkrieg you but you'll still have a fun time. USA, actually no, probably one of the worst countries to play in this whole game. Italy, you don't really have much to worry about with germany as your ally and it's a great way to  learn how to use a navy. Tips: Democracy = God no, god please no. Non-Aligned = meh. Communism = Soviets or bust. Fascism = Blitzkreig. ---------------------- Tanks, good for offence, using them for defence will make you sad. Infantry, good for defence, relatively cheap. Motorised, just get mechanised. Mechanised, discount tanks. ----------------------- Mods: Road to '56, if you don't have DLC, get this it will give you lots to do and give non-major countries focus trees. Kaiserreich, perfect if you are more into a story rather than the base game(alt history WWII). No(that german symbol), perfect if you live in a country that bans that german symbol so you can still play the game. Sandbox Decisions, if you are playing on multiplayer and have trusted friends it can give you some utilities or just give you a boosted or single player experience. TL;DR Great game, Great DLC, DLC = Mostly things that should be in updates that aren't. Ok, that about wraps it up. If you plan on getting this game I strongly recommend quill18's tutorial, believe me when I say you will not be able to play this game to any extent without watching a tutorial.",Recommended,2358.0,627.1 hrs on record,Posted: 10 March

Moreover, it's fairly historically accurate, and you can even use your knowledge of historical events to your advantage in countless ways. Yet, the company of HOI4 decided to release a number of DLCs, which the majority of them came at the expense of the completeness and the stability of the game.

They are now both 4 years old. When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide. After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side. Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay. After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as. Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends. I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together. Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today.

As for the actual game, it's great. Really good fun for a WW2 nerd, or normal person. It's a steep but rewarding learning curve. Would recommend going into a Co-op game with an experienced player and they explain the basics. Don't worry about ""Meta's"" or anything. It's a mostly single player game so play as you want. Multiplayer is fairly alive, there is even some ""e-sports"" competitions set up by popular content creators such as TommyKay. However, I wouldn't recommend multiplayer AT ALL, for a new player.

Essential DLC are Man the Guns and Waking the Tiger. Both fairly cheap on sale and included in the ¬£13 Humble Bundle. These add essential focus tree's and features.

I've played since HoI1... the series has always had a lot of potential, combined with a slew of issues that were both unnecessary and remain unresolved years after release (or ever). With HoI4 nothing has changed and you have the benefit of paying for a new broken and bugged DLC every so often. Every time there's a bunch of new things to learn and new ways they've broken both the game balance but also bugged the core game mechanics. This is not an exaggeration. For example... Right now there is a game-breaking bug in Man the Guns (more than two years after release) where the AI literally cannot build a navy. It's probably the single most upvoted bug report on the HoI forum. It's one of the very few bugs that the mods have bothered to comment on. However, Paradox refuses to say if, or when, they'll fix it. They keep selling the DLC with no warnings at the point of sale. They make no apology to the thousands of people who've already brought a product that has never worked or lived up to promise (MtG was meant to be THE naval DLC for HoI4). It's as inexcusable and dishonest as it sounds. You can find the bug report and masses of other bugs and issues in the HoI4 bug report forum. After being a die hard fan since HoI1, having made mods in the past, having spent more hours doing bug reports than I care to count... I now near-loathe Paradox. If this sounds like great 'fun', HoI4 is the game for you. If you like a game that completely lets you down after a punishing learning curve with unresolved inexcusable bugs, constantly changing mechanics and a new slew of bugs (every time there's a new DLC)... then HoI4 (and anything from Paradox really) is for YOU!

For me, HOI IV is a step in the wrong direction.  I do not like having no victory conditions.  I understand that when multi-playing, you can agree on such things beforehand, but against the computer it is nice to have a built in victory condition. I also consider the interface to be a step in the wrong direction.  HOI III had a tendency to be over-notifying, for example receiving a notification after every battle in every province.  But at least you could control that.  In HOI IV, there are very few notifications and as far as I can tell, they cannot really be changed to your playing preference.  An example:  I was playing as Germany, had a somewhat stable front against the USSR and was focusing my attention at saving Italy from an invasion into the Balkans.  While focusing on this, I out of the blue receive a banner stating that Berlin has fallen (!!).  Apparently I missed the little invasion flag and the Soviets not only invaded North of Berlin, but they were so stealthy the got all the way to Berlin without my noticing.  Can I set it up so that it warns me when I lose a province??  If yes, I cannot find it.  I turned on the comments and would truly appreciate feedback, perhaps I am missing something that would help me to enjoy this game. As with HOI III, there are many wonderful features to the game, but the interface and lack of real victory conditions are ruining it for me.",Not Recommended,1238.0,"1,292.5 hrs on record",Posted: 10 July

So I could not reclaim lost territory. There is also the whole war system bug, by this I mean, a faction can get involved in too many wars and end up being your ally and enemy at the same time. And since it's an ally you cannot attack them. However the same ai that is your ally/enemy can attack you and take your territory.

This game is made for anyone who enjoys making history through warfare. A lot of people get HOI4 wrong, the game is not about alternative history, nor is it about doing politics. All of the national focuses and political systems are made to support the warfare, just like in real life. It is about total war. The game is not without its flaws. However, they are largely overlooked by the fun combat. Some countries such as Germany are way too overpowered, especially in single-player. The plethora of mods in the workshop resolve the issue, though it you should understand that knowing Vanilla is essential in getting good at the game. Mods are a core part of the experience, and some mods totally transform the game works. For reference, mods such as The New Order and The Red Flood are more narrative driven; if you love history, you will enjoy this game.

421,VicisiouS,https://steamcommunity.com/id/VicisiouS/,"Hearts of Iron IV is a ""Grand Strategy"" game set during the turmoil of the 1930's/40's and the Second World War. You can command any nation around the world and lead it on to the world stage and on to glory. No matter which country you command, you can customize it to your liking. You can change their ideology, strengthen their economy, and lead them to dominate the earth! To start with the pros, its definitely a very enjoyable game in the early stages of any match, the feeling of evaluating what you have to work with and then building up slowly in power or starting off at a breakneck speed for some countries is spot on. The graphics, though a little rough at points are really great overall and do a wonderful job of conveying everything to the player. The menus, controls and UI, though complicated at first, are quick and efficient once you get them down. The sheer amount of variety in terms of playable countries is also a big plus. With that said, however, the game has plenty of flaws, foremost among them being the AI. It will either be the most formidable and downright unfairly impossible opponent to ever walk the Earth, or it will put up the resistance of a wet packet of spaghetti, and very rarely any level between that. And then there's the DLC. Overall, have they greatly improved the gameplay and made things more immersive? Definitely. Should these parts of the game have been cut out and then sold back to you for an added fee? Hell no. Sure, one can argue that these were aspects the devs needed extra time to implement, or that they only thought of them later on, but that does not justify that in order to play Hearts of Iron 4 in any meaningful capacity beyond a basic WW2 sim, which by this point is one of the worse aspects of the game, you need to essentially pay for the game all over again and then some, which is just not acceptable to me. So yes, overall I can say I can recommend this game for those who want a political or military wargame set in the 1930s and 40s, and who want to try interesting, unique or just plain silly alternate history options. But be very aware that the game only has so much content before you need to start relying on messing around with friends to keep it interesting, and make sure you're willing to buy at least some of the DLC, because otherwise you're not going to have much of a game to play.

A great game, optimised for all kinds of PCs (though, after 1945, it lags a bit everywhere) and great game-play that can keep you immersed from time to time.

I first just want to say that this game is amazing and is very fun to play mods with friends but here are some of my main complaints; The navy. it's pretty bad but it can be improved by buying the Man The Guns DLC and for most people that can be annoying. Paradox releases alot of DLC's that really should just be in the vanilla version of the game (the same apply's to Cities: Skylines and alot of their other games Paradox just wants money lol) I want to move onto skill trees specifically Italy's skill tree... It's not complex enough compared to the other skill trees, in other words; it's short and bad and Paradox still haven't even released a DLC for it. Now I want to move onto some pros/good things about the game; The immersion and realism. You have a choice if you want to play the game historically accurate but you also have a choice if you don't, for an example; I was once allied with Soviet Union as Poland, I was once allied with the Soviet Union as Finland, and Mexico went to war with the USA. To digest this entire review: I definitely recommend hoi4 (Hearts of Iron IV) the game is very fun. If you don't have the money for it I would wait for a sale even thought its kinda rare it still goes on sale for 10 USD once in a blue moon. Lastly I just want to say that my grammar isn't the best and I don't write reviews often but regardless thank you for reading this and I hope you have a good day/night. :)",Recommended,1240.0,341.5 hrs on record,Posted: 11 June

536,connandoners,https://steamcommunity.com/id/connandoners/,"World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of the world's countries‚Äîincluding all of the great powers‚Äîforming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. In a total war directly involving more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role in the conflict, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres, and, with the development of nuclear weapons, the only two uses of such in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in human history, and resulted in 70 to 85 million fatalities, a majority being civilians. Tens of millions of people died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on the 3rd. Under the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their ""spheres of influence"" across Finland, Romania and the Baltic states. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan (along with other countries later on). Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the UK, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history and trapping the Axis powers, crucially the German Wehrmacht, in a war of attrition. Japan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the Republic of China by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor which forced the US to declare war against Japan; the European Axis powers declared war on the US in solidarity. Japan soon captured much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943‚Äîincluding a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific‚Äîcost the Axis powers their initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned towards Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key western Pacific islands. The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories, and the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the fall of Berlin to Soviet troops, Hitler's suicide and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender on its terms, the United States dropped the first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima, on 6 August, and Nagasaki, on 9 August. Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its invasion of Manchuria, Japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 August, then signed the surrender document on 2 September 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts, and the victorious great powers‚ÄîChina, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States‚Äîbecame the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. Political integration, especially in Europe, began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities and forge a sense of common identity.",Recommended,4375.0,62.8 hrs on record,Posted: 25 May

Overall I found it to be a very, very good game. Pros - HoI is beautifully and carefully made and it shows. The warfare mechanic is the best I've ever seen, functioning by managing front lines and target points rather than micromanaging unit by unit like in other Paradox games. It makes warfare truly fun in a way that most other games of this type do not manage. Additionally, while it is based on WWII, you don't have to play a fully historical route. Want to oppose Hitler and restore the Kaiser? You can! Want to defeat Imperial Japan as China and become the preeminent Asian power? Go for it! And to accompany the choices that you can make, a historical/ahistorical mode allows for AI opponents who will either try their best to stick to real-world decisions or who will choose their own wild historical narratives that might pit you against Communist France and Fascist Britain. The addition of a great many decisions and random events based on historical context--for example reforming the Holy Roman Empire or Byzantium--keep each game fresh and new. And that's nothing to speak of the myriad of amazing mods, such as Kaiserreich (a mod based on a world where Germany won WWI), which make it into a brand new game, furthering the content available. Cons - HoI is beautiful, but it is also, at times, clunky. The game will run on lower-end PC's but the real-time clock's max speed will be dependant on your PC, and despite the wars themselves being delightful, the buildup to them, if your PC can't support the fastest speed, will take forever. Likewise, despite being very fun, HoI IV is not an easy game to jump into, and is needlessly overcomplicated at times. You can customize your units to a frightening degree, which is enjoyable for some, but unfortunately the uncustomized variants are quite weak so even if the customization isn't fun you are forced to slog through pages of internet guides to understand things like combat width and piercing to understand why you are losing instead of being fine with the premade ones. Additionally, the tutorial isn't very helpful, so you will once again require the internet's help to understand naval or air battles. Lastly, though big powers like Germany or France have exciting custom choices, secondary powers like Austria or Ireland do not, and if there even IS an exciting tree it often requires the DLC. All-in-all I would highly recommend HoI IV to anyone who loves historical strategy games, warfare simulators, or just Paradox in general. However, I will add the word of caution: Be prepared to spend your first 2-3 games utterly confused and scouring the internet for help, as well as a good bit of money on the expansions needed to make the game more fun for you (depending on the countries you are more interested in).",Recommended,2478.0,346.5 hrs on record,Posted: 22 May

I find it rephrensible, that you need the Waking the Tiger DLC to get more manpower fast, otherwise you'd have to wait multiple years between wars, so you can get some manpower back. I really enjoyed the experience and still do. There are some critical flaws like the one I mentioned, if you just have the base game. It's actually really surprising, but you need at least a mediocore device to play, since if multiple wars are going on, the performance managment is so bad that it starts to have large performance drops even on gaming PC's. You can kind of prevent that, if you turn like 3D Buildings etc. off, but the impact is small. Apart from the locked content and the performance drops, you can propably say that it is definetly in the top 10 strategy games of all time. It's very oversimplified, with frontlines and less micromanagment than in HOI1-3 and different in many other ways. What you could also point out, is that if you have a decent amount of playtime (like I do), you know many tricks and stuff like that, which makes some aspects of the game very easy. For example, if you have the Waking the Tiger DLC you have the option to annex a puppet state. For that, you need a set amount of points (which might differ in many occasions). What my point is, is that you can get those points by giving your puppet all your army equipment. And if you annex your puppet then, you get all your equipment back, since that's how it works. I don't think this was intentional, since there are many other options to get these points, but noone uses them because the named method overshadows them by a lot and there's no reason for you to do them. I personally find that a good thing, since you obviously don't have to take that option and you could just do it the harder way, if you don't want to abuse game mechanics. SO, If you like strategy games like EU4 or Victoria (for whatever reason), it's definetly something for you. Some game mechanics are badly thought out and some important content might be locked behing a DLC pay-wall (Not nearly as bad as EU4 tho), but I'd definetly recommed you to buy it. I might have exclusively listed negative points, but that's just because there are too many positive ones and I'm lazy. So don't get me wrong, I think HOI4 is absolutely amazing and it's worth your money.",Recommended,1956.0,740.2 hrs on record,Posted: 17 May

595,xnjckk,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xnjckk/,"This will be my first ever review on steam, so I might as well make it spicy. Hearts of Iron IV in my opinion is a great game, it is easier to understand imo than other Paradox games like Europa Universalis IV and so on. Does that mean those other games are better? No, does that mean HOI4 is better? Not at all. Gaming can often be subjective in terms of if a game is good or not and we often overlook that when we come to a conclusion about a video game. Hearts of Iron IV is one of those games where you can fall in love with all it's mechanics, or the fact that you can restore a monarchist Germany in 1936. The game has options in terms of alternative history that I can appreciate quite a lot. There are also a lot of things that Paradox needs to do that is quite obviously missing from their games. The Focus Trees. Some are good, most are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, and it's up to random people who enjoy the game to come up with better ones than the devs for this game. Oh, Road to 56 has focuses that don't take 70 days? Steal that! Oh, all these other mods for our game have Focus trees that are way more in depth for even minor countries? Steal that! The best focus trees in the game are mainly with the major powers, EXCEPT ITALY WHY TF ARE THEY NOT GIVING ITALY A NEW TREE THEY COULD OF HAD A PERFECT DLC BUT NO. POLAND. Poland is the country that gets a rework to the focus tree instead of Italy, a major country in WW2. Yes, makes perfect sense Paradox. Continue to disappoint us. Please. On this topic, why tf does Spain have an autobiography for a focus tree before major powers get good ones? Also who tf gives a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about Portugal in this game? The only good thing about any of these two countries in HOI4 is to form Iberia with a MOD. Mechanics. Just gonna skip this part because they're confusing but simple at the same time. Figure it out noobs. Time. This is probably the most important part of it. The time. You sit there for what feels like 10 hours trying to build up your country for the world war then you figure out that you just get steamrolled anyway. Is what I would say if I had 5 minutes in this game. But seriously, this game feels like it takes 20 years to get 1937 and that's one of my main pet peeves with Paradox games in general. You practically have to have some patience with this game just to do anything. Actually, I think that's it? Can't remember what else to complain about other than this game has the worst multiplayer capabilities since Fallout 76. Oh have all your settings to the lowest possible? Yeah your computer is just not gonna give the game enough memory to run so you're gonna be lagging behind the entire time and get kicked from multiplayer games you try to play. Have fun with that. Hope you all enjoy my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• post of a review. Might do more for other games. Don't know. Anyhow, lick my balls, get good, stay positive #cancelcancelculture uh mr. mustache man did nothing wrong, what other cringe ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• can I say?

The gameplay is indepth and satisfying when you encircle your enemies. Sure the game is confusing to learn but when you master it you can create an empire or expand an empire or hegemony with any nation from ww2. The modding community for this game is also one of most diligent I have seen because of the many overhaul and alternate history mods that exist. The only problem for the game is the overpriced DLC which add a small feature and focuses to the base game.

622,9thlevelwhitemale,https://steamcommunity.com/id/9thlevelwhitemale/,"The frontline AI will decide to shuffle provinces randomly due to one single change and cause the entire thing to collapse Unit AI will retreat inwards toward the enemy for no reason and annihilate themselves. AI will retreat from fortified positions for no reason despite having organization and strength still remaining. The AI NEVER runs out of manpower. EVER. It's a mechanic that purely affects the player and does not affect the AI AT ALL. Experience, both for units and for generals is completely broken and hasn't been fixed in years; Units will fight from 1939 to 1945 and not achieve veterancy - oftentimes regressing back to merely being ""trained"", while your generals will achieve many crushing Naval victories over and over again and never gain enough experience to train a single positive trait. The game was released early as a not-early-access thing, was incomplete and has been given $20 expansion packs that add features that should have been included in the base game. You can't stop enemy units from retreating from ports by parking your fleet outside-- their transports simply go through unimpeded; The only way to have a chance of stopping them is to order your fleets on an abstracted ""raid convoy"" mission, which is unreliable and only catches a few ships at a time. To the inverse, when you're moving your army across an ocean with a direct escort of ships, enemy submarines will attack your convoy and your fleet won't be able to intervene because you're not using the stupid abstracted mission order -- but if you DO use the order, your ships spread out across the entire sea sector and will sail from wherever the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• they are to intervene whenever submarines appear, instead of escorting convoys directly. There's a good game under all these issues, but by god you have to fight tooth and nail against your own ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• AI or they will ruin everything. It's just so stressful that it sucks the fun out of the game. Oopsie your 50,000 manpower armored division of elite tanks and mechanised just retreated for no ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• reason into the enemy front line and annihilated itself XDDDD.

642,germa2k,https://steamcommunity.com/id/germa2k/,"This game is phenomenal. It is such an incredible game that includes heartbreak, headache, joy, lust, friendship and maliciousness. This game is a roller coaster of a game that takes you through the main meaning behind why God put us on this Earth many years ago. I bought this game when I felt the lowest of lows in my life, and I came out feeling like a man. It taught me how to love, how to laugh and how to cry. You start the game as a cowardly, young, insufficient child that is just trying to find their way in life. They have to overcome various difficult obstacles that define who they are as a person and what they look for. Some of these obstacles include bear traps, wolves, bears, bear traps and most importantly, Bigfoot. Bigfoot is the polar opposite of the protagonist in this game. He is out for blood, he does not care for humanity but simply for his own survival. This to me defines how us a society struggle to appreciate the simple and beautiful things in life, and frankly the biggest obstacle the protagonist has to climb, is humanity. Bigfoot can teach all of us a lesson of how we should live our lives, he cares about himself and loves the feeling of nature's breeze through his precious hair. What is that feeling overall? Freedom. I feel that by the end of the game, you as the protagonist will come to a junction that will define whether you have changed morally as a human. Throughout this game, you are attempting to hunt Bigfoot because that is what you believe will make you fit in with the public, clearly overcome with peer pressure. Finally, after many hours of tearing through his health bar, it all comes to a stop. You are finally presented with the option to capture Bigfoot, become like every other ungrateful human in this Earth, or you can let him go. This moment is beautiful in the game. The sun shines onto Bigfoot's face as you see a tear trickle down his soft cheeks. It makes him look human. This is the moment that defines the weak boys, to strong and independent men. Free Bigfoot and you yourself have been freed from the experience and pressure of social norms. This is a fantastic game, I wish for everyone on this Earth to spend their money and buy it. It taught me such an important lesson in life, and if there is anything I have learnt from Bigfoot, it is that you should appreciate the beauty of life and live it to the fullest.

You can play as basically any nation that existed back then, and even as some that didn't. Hoi4 can seem complicated at first, but it doesn't take too long to get used to it. The basic game mechanics of Hoi4 work quite well. The actions you take are mainly guided by your focus tree. Important nations have custom focus trees, while more irrelevant ones have a basic focus tree. The focus tree includes stuff like getting more factories, demanding land, getting war goals (which allow you to start wars), starting a civil war etc. Custom focus trees have both a historical route, and one or many non-historical routes. You can restore the Kaiserreich as Germany, create the EU, restore Austria Hungary or the Ottoman Empire and so on. Many of the things done through focuses can also be done without them, such as by manually justifying war goals, building more factories etc but the focus trees (usually) give you the things for free. The focus trees are generally speaking good, although Italy and the USSR suffer from having quite poor focus trees, although that will probably be fixed in the future. The USSR is already getting a new focus tree in the next DLC. The political aspect of the game is quite simple. Ideologies are divided into four distinct ones, being democracy, fascism, communism and non-alignment. This allows the political aspect to be simple and intuitive. Countries accumulate a thing called political power over time. Different nations get it at different rates, depending on different modifiers. Pp can be used for many things such as decisions, justifying wars, getting military high command (which give modifiers to your military), design companies which give boosts to research and the stats of specific equipment, and political advisors which boost different things such as political power gain, construction speed etc. The pp system is simple and effective. There are also spy agencies, but I won't go over that here. It's relatively simple and I personally like it. You also must manage your construction (constructing civilian or military factories, infrastructure, naval dockyards, airfields, forts, you name it) and your production (producing your equipment such as guns, artillery, tanks, planes, boats etc). This system is extremely simple, although managing your naval construction can be a nuissance at times. Now, let's get into the part that actually matters: gameplay. When at war, there are a lot of things to keep track of if you want to do well, but you can also let the AI do everything for you, which is less effective but saves you time. Training new troops is simple and you can modify their division template (which essentially dictates what the division has in it and in turn affects what equipment they need and also their stats) or create new ones. Actually managing troops is also quite simple. Divisions go under generals, who go under field marshals. With base traits a general can control 24 divisions without getting any debuffs, and a field marshal can control 5 generals. These can be upgraded to 30 and 7 respectively. Your field marshals and generals gain experience as they fight, which improves their passive modifiers (damage, defense, planning and supply consumption) and also gives you points to use on giving them different traits which give more specific buffs. You can give different orders to generals and field marshals and then either let them execute the orders by themselves, or micromanage your troops to, for example, encircle enemy divisions much more effectively. You also have air and naval combat. Air combat is relatively simple. You manufacture planes, which you then send on different missions. The map is divided into air zones, and you assign your planes on specific air zones for a specific task (or tasks) such as air superiority, ground support, interception, bombing etc. Naval combat is the least important of the three, but by far the most annoying. The naval combat was almost entirely redone in the Man the Guns DLC, and while it is better, it still isn't good. Managing your ships is annoying and confusing, sometimes your ships just don't want to do what you want to tell them to etc. The game doesn't have too many bugs, but it does have some minor and some more major ones, although many of them are the exploity type and won't affect you as a player negatively. This was quite a surface level overview of Hoi4 and it is much deeper than this, but this should be a decent basic overview. I really enjoy Hoi4 as should be obvious from my hours. It has its good and bad sides of course, but in general it's a very good game if you like grand strategy and history.",Recommended,3978.0,"1,727.5 hrs on record",Posted: 16 April

It's one of Paradoxs best games released and should continue being fun for a long time. For newcomers to the strategy genre it's probably the easiest game to pick up amongst all Paradox titles. While still being very in-depth it offers an easy basic mechanics system that's understandable after playing with it for a few hours. Mastering it provides a real challenge and even I don't know about every little aspect with more to come with a usual DLC or major update once or twice a year. What makes the game so special is it's complexity, the interesting and to a certain level very diverse battle and warfare methods (the best in any strategy game by far), and the freedom you enjoy when it comes to how you want your games to turn out. This freedom is supported by the biggest strength Paradox games enjoy: Their compatibility with mods and the integration within the small but dedicated community. Mods are fairly easy to create compared to most other games but provide a decent amount of flexibility and creativity with a very wide range of possibilities. You can create your very personal games based on what the player wants focus on. To sum it up: Pros: - ""Easy"" to learn for newcomers, a real challenge to master - Freedom of play, alternative history (focus trees, decisions, events)... - Awesome community, surprisingly good youtubers/streamers - large variety of mods, active support and modding scene, easily moddable - Regularly updated - Bug free (If you don't care about some exploits and meta strategies) - Interesting warfare mechanics - Competitive on less speed/reflex focused basis Negatives: - Not as politically challenging as f.ex. EUIV or CK3 (if you need it) - Some harder to understand mechanics - Pricey DLCs (always wait for holidays/sale's before you buy) - Games are sometimes unplayable after around 8 years (Division spam, no new Focuses,... = Mods are your friend and a good PC too) - Multiplayer servers are usually unstable when playing with a lot of players",Recommended,1740.0,"1,215.0 hrs on record",Posted: 13 April

681,wanoO,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wanoO/,"A solid game and my personal favorite when it comes to PDX grand strategy titles. It's got a steep learning curve and the very short tutorial won't be enough to teach you how to win a campaign.However once you get over that initial hurdle, it's a one of a kind game with no direct competitor. So if you want to steer a nation to victory during the greatest conflict in human history then this is it. It has massively improved over previous iterations to make it more approachable to new players and every major update brings solid improvements to its mechanics. While the AI struggles to play the game and can fail spectacularly at times, it does an acceptable job and deserve more credit than it gets. Yet, after a hundred hours or so it should no longer really challenge you once you figure out building up and optimizing your units. Multiplayer has its share of issues as you will no longer be able to play at your own pace and you have to find people who can play for hours on end without rage quitting. The MP meta is rather strange but the game has competitive potential and a high experience ceiling. Many mechanics such as intelligence, occupation management, ship designer, general traits and certain tactics are gated behind Paradox's DLC scheme sadly; at their full price they are very much overpriced given the persisting bugs and unsolved balancing issues that PDX is well aware of but ignores. Playing without some of these mechanics is doable but can become tedious and frustrating. Same as the base title, I would recommend you avoid buying any of these DLCs at full price as it's completely unreasonable to pay over 150‚Ç¨ for the full package imo, especially considering the quality of some DLCs. It's not as bad as EU4 in that respect but in time it may catch up to it as DLC locked features are added in, with the base game straying further and further from what the current version is actually balanced for. The modding community is absolutely amazing with big names such as RT56 or Kaiserreich which completely overhaul the game, definitely worth checking out. However, at 50% off or better this game is a steal and hours of fun if you like managing large fronts, industrial production and waging war across continents: 8/10 Best of its kind but suffers from poor play-testing and flawed DLC model.",Recommended,1911.0,"1,703.4 hrs on record",Posted: 8 April

I had never really played something like it before (spare Plague Inc., which is kind of similar), and it was a source of frustration for the many hours I tried to understand how to play. Please watch some playthroughs on YouTube first, as it can get incredibly overwhelming fast if you don't know what you're doing. With that being said, this game is awesome. I bought it specifically for the Old World Blues mod, as I'm a massive Fallout fan. However, playing it in ""vanilla"" is amazing as well. I'm a bit of a World War II nut, and this delivered, 100%. The skill and focus trees, the weapons, the events, I love it all. The only complaint that I really have is that the music is awfully repetitive, at least for my tastes. I usually turn the volume all the way down on my computer and just listen to my own tunes with my headphones, connected to my phone. I hope this review was decent, as the only other review I've put on this site (at least, to my knowledge) was for Skyrim when I was ten.

As with all Paradox games, the gameplay is drastically improved by the incredibly overpriced DLC, but unlike many of them it's not half as necessary to buy *all* of them to feel like you have a complete game.

890,HereticKannon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HereticKannon/,"The base game is alright and has steadily improved since release but the lack of content takes its toll on vanilla after a couple playthroughs. The real selling point of this game is the incredible work being done by the modding community. Kaiserreich - for alternate history fans Old World Blues - for Fallout or post-apocalyptic fans Road to 56 - for people who want an improved base game experience The New Order - for people who enjoy suffering Equestria at War - for people who enjoy psychological horror The list goes on for major overhaul mods with a staggering amount of content. For context a lot of what makes each nation special is their focus tree which they use to shape and evolve the country. As today, May 28th, 2021, if you own *all* of the DLC then there are 33 countries with unique focus trees in the base game, some being much worse than others (looking at you, Italy). Meanwhile Kaiserreich has over 90 unique focus trees for the starting date and many more from countries spawning via events as the game progresses. You can spend hundreds of hours playing through different countries on many of these overhaul mods and still have only experienced a fraction of what they have to offer. If you do buy HoI4 there's almost certainly at least one overhaul mod that appeals to you that will draw you in more than just sticking with vanilla would. tl;dr - HoI4 is a decent game but it's a better framework for modders to build on than anything else.",Recommended,1204.0,"1,188.7 hrs on record",Posted: 28 May

893,76561197991780821,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991780821/,"This is a splendid game - I have hundreds and hundreds of hours playing at this point. I'm essentially reviewing this game with all of the available content DLCs (and none of the nonsensical sprite packs, which just aren't worth money to me), so be aware of that (and know that my recommendation is to wait and buy on heavy discount for the base game and the DLCs!) Let me put it this way... I was determined in my latest game that I would play a Mexico that would choose a ""middle path,"" side with the United States after demanding oil concessions, and essentially be a good ancillary power in the war against the threats to world peace. Well, I'd turned off ""historical settings"" (but had ironman on), so things can go fairly ahistorically - they did! The Balkans formed a ""Balkan Entente"" under Romania, while the German Wehrmacht overthrew Adolf Hitler, re-establishing the Kaiserreich in Germany, the authority of the Habsburgs in Austria, Hungary, and the Czech-Slovak lands, and Victor Immanuel in Italy. The Japanese, meanwhile, were victorious in a swift war against China that concluded with a bid to invade the Soviet Union after the Soviets invaded (and took) the Baltic States and Poland. Japan's deep thrust into Soviet territory paid off in a declaration of war from the German Empire - the Kaiser's troops victoriously conquered Moscow and Leningrad in mid-1942 and the Germans divided the Soviet Union with Japan. Meanwhile, however, the French Republic under Leon Blum had failed in its effort to achieve rapprochement with the Communists, who overthrew Blum and installed Maurice Thorez as leader - apparently the geostrategic threat of Germany and Japan leading the British to maintain good relations with the new Communist regime. The Americans, however, would have none of this - despite the dramatic expansion of Japan in East Asia, and German aggression in Soviet Russia, the Americans declared war on none other than the Communists in France! Mexico? My Mexico saw reconciliation with Plutarcho Calles and the continuation of the revolutionary land reform efforts so central to Zapata's revolution - this meant that the Caudillos were bound to revolt, which happened in due time. The revolt of the Caudillos was suppressed with some effort while Mexico continued its slow climb toward economic and military relevancy on the global scale. The American declaration of war gave the Mexican government its opportunity to side with the Yanks against their enemies, but in the meantime, the Mexican people had requested that President Lazaro Cardenas fulfill his promises to the people of Mexico; he obliged: the Mexican Socialist Republic, a would-be staunch ally of the USA, emerged as a powerful promise for freedom in the world - all for naught! The US had joined the Balkan Entente after its declaration of war - and faction leader Romania apparently had no tolerance for socialist allies! The Mexicans were duly booted from the alliance, but not because we'd declared war on Japan, dragging the entire alliance into a worldwide war that would force the Americans to defend the peoples of the Pacific - or to gave way to those that would. On our own, we were swiftly faced with the consequences of our increasing isolation as the resources that had poured into Mexico from democratic America now went preferentially to democratic-capitalist regimes in the Balkans, leaving Mexican factories starved of the inputs necessary to build a modern economy. As per usual, the capitalists were aligning themselves such as to exclude a democratically-elected people's government from surviving without the political and economic dominance of imperialist powers - only one alternative lay open to the democratic Socialist Republic of Mexico - a preemptive strike south supported by years of slow and patient investment in fortresses along the northern border. Unsurprisingly, this strike left the Americans in a position of obligation that led to war between our two nations, despite the peaceful initial intentions of the Mexican government. Sadly, the Yanks had already committed the bulk of their land forces to a life-or-death struggle against the French and British that now raged across Central Europe and the Balkans as the Germans and Italians suffered casualties reaching into the multiple tens of millions before falling before the forces of the combined British, French, Belgian, and Dutch forces. This left the southern border vulnerable at a time when the Americans had not anticipated aggression from the previously conciliatory Mexicans, whose careful palliation of the Church despite the socialist government had done much to mint a hardline revanchist mentality among the Mexican people, reminded now of the crimes of the war of 1848. Sensing opportunity, the Mexican military under command of Field Marshal Calles shattered the American lines; first in California, then Arizona, and finally blasting through the thin line of defending divisions remaining on American soil in Texas to send swift-moving cavalry and armored car divisons rampaging through an American countryside that had been thoroughly infiltrated by Mexican agents preparing a collaboratory regime. The campaign against America stretched for the better part of 12 months, but resulted in the complete capitulation of the government in Washington; remaining Americans forces under Patton are bottled up in Alaska, where local conditions have rendered an offensive difficult at this time. North America is largely secured and the prep work of Mexican agents has led to a quiescent and compliant populace, much which feels relieved at the sudden dramatic increases in infrastructure improvement and living standards, and which is fully prepared to contribute to a glorious future for the Mexican cause: for the the capitulation of the German-led Central Powers did not resolve conflict in the world, or even Europe. The Japanese invaded from their ever-more hardened strongholds in Asia and conquered the French and British alike and now have targeted North America for invasion. It is 1950, and this war has consumed countless lives, although relatively few of them Mexican. Can the Socialist Republic of Mexico survive?

899,76561198805427167,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198805427167/,"One of my favorite strategy games in my library. Hearts of Iron IV is a real time battle strategy game taking place in WWII in which you get to choose which nation you wish to play as  and then  you play starting from either 1936 or 1939 up to 1950 at which point the game ends. During this time you will have to manage everything a nation will need to fund a military and be succesful in a world war with such an army. This includes RnD, Managing internal politics through a focus tree and decisions, Constructing Civilian factorys and Military ones to get your the resources and supplys to both produce your army equipment as well as manufacture it, As well as designing your army from the ground up and then activily leading it both on the micro and macro.  The game has a steep learning curve and is very fun I am 1000 hours in and still learning. The base game has solid historical paths for all majors and some even have some good alternative roots. If you don't like mods the DLCS are quite nice as well as they can give you many ahistorical routes. (Kaiserreich Germany any one ?). However, what takes this game above and beyond and inspired me to write this review is the modding scene. The Mod community for this game is ridicoulous. If you ever wanted to role play a world through the lense of a strategy game then just buy this as their is a mod to scratch your itch. For example one of the greatest mods in the Oldworld blues mod in which you get to take control of one of hundreds of nations in and around the mojave. Most of these nations even have better focus trees then the ingame ones which is amazing.

They are now both 4 years old. When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide. After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side. Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay. After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as. Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends. I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together. Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that. Thank you Paradox Interactive",Recommended,2099.0,6.6 hrs on record,Posted: 15 April

As long as you show any sign of hostility towards Italy or Germany their troops will be pretty much all on your border when the scripted path to fall of France begins. And by the time Germans haul their butts back to their west border UK will land 100 divisions in Belgium. But all this was expected, even if to nowhere near as bad of a degree. Writing good AI is hard. Now the unforgivable part, the scoring, war contributions and the peace treaty. Which makes any game completely ****** after the first peace is signed. Arbitrary game score doesn't bother me much, it just looks stupid that air force takes 80+% of it. 200 for 200 industrial capacity and then 1200 for 12000 air superiority score. In comparison your 150 divisions are worth 22. Doesn't really affect the game, but it looks stupid. And its indicative of a larger problem. War contribution score... the game killer. There are 4 categories : Occupation: Makes sense, except Soviets get score for taking eastern Poland in a war score against Germans. Strategic Bombing: Sure, why not, it has a cap so it doesn't break anything Sunk Enemy Ships: It has some effect, nowhere near as it should, and also sinking a carrier or a battleship is worth exactly as much as sinking a destroyer or a submarine. Tonnage anyone? And last and most atrocious - Casualties: Basically if you're warring against Japan's faction, you can't beat Chinese war score, because they lost 10 million troops and whatever you did can't come nowhere near that score. Same with Soviets wasting 7M+ troops against Germans. Then comes peace, the German Reich is done for... except, its still on the map, its still at war with everyone, usually accompanied by Slovakia. Soviets will take some beaches in southern France, maybe a Mediterranean island or 2, and Madagascar also seems popular. Italy for some reason, never having switched sides can make demands. As can Austria. I get an option as 4th highest score (lost only 250k troops) to liberate Czechoslovakia, only Slovakia still exists and i can just liberate a single core province leaving everything else squarely in German Reich. France fell, so it doesn't have much of a score, so it will lose half its territory to Soviets, UK and the likes + all colonial holdings... Enough of an example, looks like someone made a failed random map mod and implemented it as a peace treaty tool. I can't understand how you even gave a system in this bad of a state to your QA for preliminary testing, let alone released it. 5 Expansions and 12 DLCs later, its still completely broken. And in the state its in now, there is no way it worked as intended even once, so you were fully aware it is broken. And you just did not care. Had to make those DLCs, hey?

1091,oublaz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/oublaz/,"A great game of grand strategy, also the greatest scam I could witness by myself, and I did work for an insurance company. If you never played any games like this one, don‚Äôt expect to see tanks shooting at each other, you will mostly stare at maps filled with small symbols for hours that represent your frontlines clashing against other units. Heart of iron is mostly a game about logistics and calculation, but you will probably get overwhelmed by the daunting amount of things to think about, and forget about most of them. I, for example, didn‚Äôt know I had a navy to manage until at least 100 of hours in. But I still had fun making sure that Fascist Tibet would backstab China and be the true Asian overlord. There‚Äôs two fun parts in that game, micro managing units, and doing unexpected things, like preventing that German moustache-wearing guy to invade half of Europe by invading him first in 1936, in the name of whatever nowadays-irrelevant ideology they used to believe in back then. Once you did win WW2 as intended, or did rewrite history once or two, the game could get stale, do not worry, because the base game is hard to understand, but quite lacking, and there‚Äôs a big pile of dlc for you to buy to fill the void and unlock the (overpriced) content (that should have been in the base game). And then once you clear that content, do not worry! Because the modding community got your back. Utopia, Dystopia, Historical, Star Wars, Post-apocalyptic, Anime, Ponies, whatever you want, a modding team or a basement living made it, and most of the time, they do a better job at it than the base game devs. You will certainly feel bad for buying those overpriced dlcs, but it‚Äôs fine, because every mechanics added are put to a good use in most mods. Also, buy the base game first, see if you can understand it before buying the dlcs, and buy them on sales. Don‚Äôt be an idiot with your money.

There is still a fair bit of that left in the game. The principle argument I have against it still stands.  Too many of the critical game concepts are too opaque.  In particular, the way the AI fights your battles is how I would expect someone on LSD would fight it.  I am orders of magnitude more effective directing forces myself.  For example, An automated battle on the Malaysian peninsula  had the AI endlessly shuffling divisions, creeping up the peninsula despite a vast quantitative and qualitative advantage.  After letting it do its thing for a month, it made it 1/3 of the way up.  I took over and in 3 weeks went all the way up the peninsula to Bankok and up to Rangoon. Additionally, Front line fighting units (other than capital ships) never seem to gain experience beyond their training.  Either  the experience gain from winning is too low or the experience loss for even very minor casualties is too high, but it should be fixed.  A unit that has been fighting and winning for 3 years should achieve at least one more level of experience. There is a fair number of things to like about the game.  Division building is interesting and you can customize in more ways than you will ever want.  Organizing armies and fleets is very easy as well. But again, the opacity of game concepts makes for a learning curve that borders on not worth it.  You will become reliant on non-developer information to make any headway in this regard, which is really not a very good way to develop a game. I eliminated the DLC for espionage.  Not worth the added trouble.  The naval game is still uncooperative at times.  Much like the automated armies, fleets do some unpredictable and weird things on occasion.  Not sure if the is connected to the Man The Guns DLC as I have not played without that yet. The research, development and upgrade system is quite good along with how factories work.  They work hand in hand quite well, although production penalties for upgrading to a new model are a bit stiff.  It's still a good system that lets you chart an industrial plan. Some issues with the way the UI works; it's easy to make horrible mistakes. Overall,  if it goes on a big sale again, you might want to give it a shot.  At full price, this is a pass as while it has some really nice features, it isn't the total game HOI2 was. EDIT: I am changing this from a not recommended to recommended.  I am still playing it after all these hours so there must be something there.  I would still wait for it to go on sale and my other comments still stand, so if you are a grand wargame grognard, you will probably enjoy this, eventually, if you don't set your hair on fire first.",Recommended,2240.0,277.6 hrs on record,Posted: 22 March

My biggest problem with this game is , that every conflict turns into a world war there are no regional conflicts because the AI always joins some faction that has 21312 other members.  lets say you play Cuba and want to annex Haiti and they are a part of the Soviet block you are at war with the soviets and mongolia which makes no sense , why would a major power that clearly has other problems give a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about a small island in the caribbean that has no strategical value to them? No ressources, no big army, not an important strategic location. and there aren't really any Diplomatic options all the ""Diplomatic options"" are either forced thrue focus trees , or its simple improve relations/non aggression treaty etc and then theres also the fact that you can be on the max amount of relation with a nation and they still will join a war against u if some bum‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• nation declares war on you and they are in the same faction. It's really a shame this game would be great if you were not forced to fight the entire world everytime and it simply makes this a global domination game. There are no negotiations like they advertise it. you always HAVE to conquer their entire country and all of the faction members countries if your target nation is in one it just sucks. and don't get me started on the research system, you basically got research slots , how much depends on the nation you play and the focus trees you picked, lets say you got 2 research slots and pick 1 for military doctrine and the other one for tanks and never pick something else and you picked a nation that starts with world war 1 infantry equipment this means you are basically stuck the entire game with world war 1 infantry equipment which is just dumb. It should work this way. You pick a technology your researchers FOCUS on and it gets researched faster because of this the rest gets unlocked passivly as time goes on. just takes the fun out of the game that I can have a large 1944 air craft carrier but it still uses some double decker airplanes from 1910 if i don't tell big brain scientist guy to research a new plane.",Not Recommended,1863.0,467.5 hrs on record,Posted: 12 May

The plus for HOI is that unlike a lot of ""historical"" games the AI players have been given a historical script so that Botswana doesn't randomly conquer the British isles ensuring a game that follows the proper historical beats. In addition you can endlessly tweak and adjust various units and plan complex operations. But that's where it's merits end. The AI doesn't have any reason for doing what it's doing beyond following the script. If the US doesn't block steel sales to Japan they still attack Pearl Harbor on schedule. If that were HOI's only problem it would still be recommendable. Vapid modern political propaganda makes this game un-recommendable. Socialism is presented as an opposing position to fascism when socialism/fascism/communism are ideologically identical in any meaningful way. The Devs paint WWII as a great socialist victory against fascism. To further this false opposition everything the Devs woke agenda opposes gets lumped into fascism. Deregulation? That's fascist. Gold standard? That's fascist. Privatized industry? That's fascist. Ending the Great Depression through means other than socialism? That's fascist. Religion? That's fascist.

And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters. 1:3. And God said: Be light made. And light was made. 1:4. And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness. 1:5. And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning one day. 1:6. And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters. A firmament... By this name is here understood the whole space between the earth, and the highest stars. The lower part of which divideth the waters that are upon the earth, from those that are above in the clouds. 1:7. And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so. 1:8. And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning were the second day. 1:9. God also said; Let the waters that are under the heaven, be gathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it was so done. 1:10. And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. 1:11. And he said: let the earth bring forth green herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done. 1:12. And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seed each one according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 1:13. And the evening and the morning were the third day. 1:14. And God said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven, to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years: 1:15. To shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the earth, and it was so done. 1:16. And God made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars. Two great lights... God created on the first day, light, which being moved from east to west, by its rising and setting, made morning and evening. But on the fourth day he ordered and distributed this light, and made the sun, moon, and stars. The moon, though much less than the stars, is here called a great light, from its giving a far greater light to the earth than any of them. 1:17. And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth. 1:18. And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good. 1:19. And the evening and morning were the fourth day. 1:20. God also said: let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven. 1:21. And God created the great whales, and every living and moving creature, which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 1:22. And he blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth. 1:23. And the evening and morning were the fifth day. 1:24. And God said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind, cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, according to their kinds. And it was so done. 1:25. And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle, and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And God saw that it was good. 1:26. And he said: Let us make man to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth. Let us make man to our image... This image of God in man, is not in the body, but in the soul; which is a spiritual substance, endued with understanding and free will. God speaketh here in the plural number, to insinuate the plurality of persons in the Deity. 1:27. And God created man to his own image: to the image of God he created him: male and female he created them. 1:28. And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth. Increase and multiply... This is not a precept, as some Protestant controvertists would have it, but a blessing, rendering them fruitful; for God had said the same words to the fishes, and birds, (ver. 22) who were incapable of receiving a precept. 1:29. And God said: Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind, to be your meat: 1:30. And to all beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they may have to feed upon. And it was so done. 1:31. And God saw all the things that he had made, and they were very good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day. Genesis Chapter 2 God resteth on the seventh day and blesseth it. The earthly paradise, in which God placeth man. He commandeth him not to eat of the tree of knowledge. And formeth a woman of his rib. 2:1. So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them. 2:2. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. He rested, etc... That is, he ceased to make or create any new kinds of things. Though, as our Lord tells us, John 5.17, ""He still worketh"", viz., by conserving and governing all things, and creating souls. 2:3. And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. 2:4. These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth: 2:5. And every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew: for the Lord God had not rained upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth. 2:6. But a spring rose out of the earth, watering all the surface of the earth. 2:7. And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul. 2:8. And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed. 2:9. And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The tree of life... So called because it had that quality, that by eating of the fruit of it, man would have been preserved in a constant state of health, vigour, and strength, and would not have died at all. The tree of knowledge... To which the deceitful serpent falsely attributed the power of imparting a superior kind of knowledge, beyond that which God was pleased to give. 2:10. And a river went out of the place of pleasure to water paradise, which from thence is divided into four heads. 2:11. The name of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold groweth. 2:12. And the gold of that land is very good: there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone. 2:13. And the name of the second river is Gehon: the same is it that compasseth all the land of Ethiopia. 2:14. And the name of the third river is Tigris: the same passeth along by the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates. 2:15. And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise of pleasure, to dress it, and to keep it. 2:16. And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat: 2:17",Not Recommended,6422.0,0.2 hrs on record,Posted: 6 August

1208,Kazat0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kazat0/,"If you've never played a paradox game before, Hearts of Iron 4 might be a little tedious to get the hang of but it is by no means a very hard game. It's very micro-intensive probably more so than the previous game Hearts of Iron 3. It is by far my favorite grand strategy WW2 game (and other scenarios with mods) and is definitely a better game than the first. Pros: -More user-friendly UI than HOI3 -More user-friendly trading system and resource management -Better industrial system than the previous game allowing you to build specific factories in certain states -Revamped construction mechanics that feel more natural. -Fuel and oil management doesn't feel too hard but adds a challenge -Nice supply system that is incorporated with tiles and infrastructure that allow for devastating encirclement maneuvers -Smaller unit of distance called a tile that allows for more precise troop movement and smaller encirclements -Newer game with more modern code and engine, more stability. -Better decisions mechanic -Amazing modding community with diverse and high-quality mods that can add some freshness to the game Cons: -No money mechanic like in the previous game, everything is based upon industry, trade, and equipment. -AI can be very stupid at times which is bad because your allies will be at a disadvantage and your enemy will feel too stupid and easy -Some small nations or minors do not have fully customized focus trees and makes players lean towards more major powers to get a better gameplay experience -Game gets extremely laggy as time progresses about 5-10 years. -Some mechanics or bugs allow some players to claim the game is too easy and not realistic enough and other players to claim it is too hard and too realisitic -AI peace deals can make your world look like somebody threw up on a canvas (can be fixed with mods) -Extremely expensive if you buy the major expansion DLC which is basically required to have a great experience with this game.

The game most definitely has a learning curve and will take time to have a good grasp on its content/ mechanics. Some things that I don't like are how often the game tends to crash in the late game, and also how the late game (1942 and onwards) gets extremely slow, but this is a personally issue. This game is very CPU heavy, RAM, SSD and GPU do not matter much. FPS can get below 30 sometimes but it is not a deal breaker for me.

Did you think they would actually implement features to the game that make it fun? You shouldn't have if you did. This game is paint the map simulator, along with pretty much every other Paradox game. The only strategy found here is changing the big blue color on the map to maybe a big red color, or even a big yellow color. The national focus tree basically just guides nations and gives you stuff for free. I feel like someone is holding my hand all the way through the game, but its not comforting. It's more like a greasy, nasty, sweaty type of hand holding onto you. You don't like it, but you can't get away from it either. Unless you just uninstall the game, I did that just now.

(and it goes on sale often as well) Its a difficult game to learn, but once you understand how to play the game it's a joy to play and see all of the different paths you can take for a large number of nations. If you like History and grand strategy, this game is for you. Some of the things you can do in this game are: - Restore the Kaiser as Germany - Restore the Ottoman Empire as Turkey - Communist America - Fascist England - Restore the Roman Empire as Italy - Restore the Holy Roman Empire as Germany - The Second American Civil War - Restore the Byzantine Empire OR the Macedonian Empire as Greece - Restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire - Restore the Shogunate - Pretend to hate Jews ironically. - play as Luxembourg and try not to die. - Restore the United Kingdom of Portugal and Brazil - Be the Soviet Union and do communist things - Make Communist Netherlands - Genocide the Kurds - Turn Mexico into a Catholic Crusade in the Americas - etc. etc. There are TONS of great ways to play this game, even if the game is vanilla. There are also a whole bunch of awesome mods on the workshop that add so much value to this game, such as a Fallout mod and a World War 1 mod. I would recommend this game (Especially its DLC) when it goes on sale however, the sales come often and it makes the DLC for the game much more fairly priced. DLC I would recommend you get (ON SALE) first if you enjoy the vanilla experience: - Waking the Tiger: Adds TONS of fun to Germany, China, Japan and some other things. - Death or Dishonor: Lots of play value for England, Aussies, New Zealand, South Africa, India and others. - Together for Victory: Adds lots of options to the Balkan countries like Yugoslavia, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary etc.",Recommended,1594.0,557.9 hrs on record,Posted: 28 February

On its own as a base game, taken purely as face value, its an acceptable and interesting WW2 strategy game that you can get a good 100 hours of playing out of. The thing is, I'm really not so sure if HOI4's main draw *is* its vanilla experience. The core elements have been polished in DLC since the beginning launch and some new countries have gotten reworked focus tress but we all know the reason why this game is such a success, particularly on steam; the modding community and the workshop. The workshop produces content far superior to the base game and is the Kraby Patty Secret Forumuler to this game's longevity and the cult that surrounds it. I don't think thats unfair to say in 2021, where the game's core development seems to constantly be trailing the mod community and where the majority of players that haven't played Hoi4 are coming in to play a high profile mod. Okay, so, a strong mod community that creates great content for this game for free *should* be a draw right? And if you're just a run of the mill player it totally its. You're spoiled for choices even when using just the vanilla game sans DLC with thousands of hours ahead of you. But from the *modding* side itself, I can honestly say that HOI4 has the most hostile, obtuse, and unfriendly customization system compared to any other modern Paradox game. Its almost toxic with how inaccessible it is, which in itself contributes to a lot of the more aweful aspects of the mod community that's kept hidden from your base player. I've been on many a dev team thats abide literal, unironic nazis living out their Waffen-SS power fantasies for no other reason than because they understand the esoteric art of ""how to make a focus tree and event chain that doesn't crash."" And before I get accused of just not being good enough at learning, I've contributed to several mod teams in my time; this is a matter of how after five years of development we are no closer to having easily accessible customization options baked into the game. My point here is buyer beware; you've probably heard of this title from the amazing mods behind it, but actually creating these mods is a soul crushingly obtuse process compared to other Paradox Games, and a lot of the teams left that *are* able to produce content for this hell-ware are often of questionable morale fiber.",Not Recommended,1955.0,779.6 hrs on record,Posted: 1 August

You need to watch several guides on land, air and naval warfare in order to play, the way game designers want you to play, as there is no other way to do things. Another issue is the lack of clear intuitive interface. I like to know what's going on when playing such a grand strategy but there seem to be a lack of proper reporting and overview on what's going on where. Sometimes you need to look for small indicators across the map (naval accidents), sometimes you will find report next to a theater window (land battle result). I wish there was a message system and settings similar to what was in EU3 in order to filter all the information you want to see and have it in one place. At the same time there's bunch of unnecessary game-pausing flavour pop-up screens giving useless info on events that do not have impact on gameplay whatsoever (Hindenbourg crash etc.) NAVY 1/10 - Forget historical composition and organization of your fleets! First thing you need to do, is to gather your fleet in one port in order to reorganize it (!) The way it work is that you need to have one fleet per task (riding fleet, escort fleet etc.) Historical organization of the fleet is not working even though at the start of the game you will have them neatly orgnized this way. Why? Because task forces in a fleet can't be assigned various missions to various regions. One fleet consisting of many task forces can operate on same set of regions - no point having versalite fleets as it is in real life. AIR FORCE 5/10 - the way air warfare work is better than navy - definitely more intuitive and simple. However! How are planes delivered across the globe when transitioning between airbases regardless their range, enemy controlled airspace, possible land and sea transport routes is beyond my comprehension. They simply go in a straight line across all enemy territories across continents and oceans. Seriously? LAND WARFARE - 7/10 Battle plans are nice idea but they're broken. The idea behind it was to enable you to give orders to your generals to prepare and execute battle plans so you don't have to manually micromanage every single division. In reality micromanage is what you will be doing most of the time anyway. Want your generals to perform spearhead maneuver? Forget it and do it yourself. ESPIONAGE 10/10 - Well executed feature - the best so far. Le Resistance is a must have DLC. DESIGNING DIVISIONS AND EQUIPMENT VARIANTS IN ORDER TO SEE HOW THEY PERFORM IN BATTLE - 10/10 I love and hate this game at the same time. Preparing for war is so cool - division designing, planning your strategies, assigning generals, admirals and political figures, making important political decisions, managing equipment production, research etc. However there are serious issues with this game.",Not Recommended,2346.0,330.5 hrs on record,Posted: 26 July

I recommend watching some gameplay of the game beforehand to reassure yourself that it isn't an epic action shooter. another thing to mention before i move on; The mods.     This game has a tremendous amount of mods and outer-content thanks to its wonderful community, which furthermore add to the replayability of the game. with all that said, here are some cons : The game is really hard.      Having played 50 hours I still know a fraction of the mechanics and maneuvers and what not. The pricing- as most of you are aware, this game has a really big selection of DLCs- and a lot of content is locked behind those DLCs (some costing as much as the base game) Not to say the game is unplayable without them, but it sure is a shame they cost so much",Recommended,736.0,269.9 hrs on record,Posted: 21 June

But where do I begin? I got this game in late 2016 at the advice of my best friend, because he knew how much I loved WW2. It was my freshman year of high school and HOI4 was one of my first steam games. I can still remember launching it for the first time and starting my very first game as little Belgium (after a short and confusing tutorial of course) , and feeling absolutely overwhelmed by all the different things in the game. I was just beginning to learn a few things and BAM! I get totally steamrolled by the classic German Blitzkrieg. So ended my first game. As I played more and more, I loved this game all the more. Each and every nation on Earth is playable and each have their own unique opportunities every play through. As the player may pick one of four ideologies (Democracy, Fascism, Communism, and Non-Aligned) and lead their nation as its respective leader. Starting in 1936, (or 1939) the player builds up the economic and military might of their nation and prepares for the inevitable world war. Once the nation goes to war, the player uses combined air, naval, and land forces to defeat the enemy. You can also appoint famous WW2 generals and admirals to lead your men to victory. But don't go thinking that historical WW2 happens every single game, as there are a bunch of alternative what-if scenarios that the player may take their nation down, leading to a thousand different possibilities. Some of my favorites include: the Kaiser returns to Germany, Spain joins the war, Imperialist Britain, Aggressive America, or just making a random nation fascist and attempting world conquest, to name a few. I love thinking up various scenarios before I play and then attempting to complete them. Also a great game to play with friends as you can play different nations and team up or fight, or even play as the same nation. I've enjoyed this game all these years, and I look forward to many more enjoyable hours of Hearts of Iron 4. Now let me wrap up this review real quick as I'm about to go play it right now. :)",Recommended,1749.0,"2,022.2 hrs on record",Posted: 9 August

From the perspective of a HOI3 player, everything except the frontline system is a major step up. As an RTS player, it delegates a great deal of micromanagement and plays a lot like a management game, or a wargame with a super high emphasis on production management. Of course, if you assault too aggressively or otherwise take too many losses, your divisions aren't going to keep their combat effectiveness. It's really quite well done, but it is buggy, especially the front line system when dealing with Crimea and the Netherlands, in that it ends at certain land crossings that are mostly water. It also can't be set across multiple countries' borders unless you're at war with them... which makes attacking the lowlands and defending initially as china hard.

In a nutshell, for me, it sucks because of one simple reason: - Lack of control I always feel I can't control my navy, I can't control my planes and can't control my armies unless I start drawing unintuitive lines on the map that my units will follow in the most catastrophic way possible and I keep having this feel that everything is diluted and dumb down.

Bearing in mind I'm running the Expert AI mod and even then the AI fails basic tasks like garrisoning critical strategic locations. The AI will attack with tank divisions through mountains, and with mountain divisions through open plains. It never follows any kind of plan, and constantly makes bad decisions, which are so extreme that if you exploit them its gamebreaking. You have to literally hold yourself back otherwise its too easy, and vs. the AI is already easy.

1494,76561198382748789,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198382748789/,"Hearts of Iron IV is currently the best global RTS World War 2 game around at this moment in time. That does not mean this is a good game though. The only reason I said this first sentence is because there are no other good games that take a similar format that I have found. Even though I have played this game for a 1,000 hours and I plan on another 300 more I can not say I ""enjoy"" this game. My only real way to describe my relationship with this game would be to compare it to an abusive relationship. The moment you begin to enjoy or love the game you are in some sort of screw up will occur that either makes no sense, you couldn't predict, you have no way of countering, or fixing reasonably. In my opinion this further pushes players to constantly cheat or play the latest meta only so that they are less likely to lose due to some random screw up. This is can be difficult to see in multiplayer but is EXTREMELY prevelant in singleplayer.  The same thing also leaves the game empty of creativity unless players are doing a meme invasion or strategy. Occasionally I see a strategy that makes me think ""hey good idea, that was pretty creative"" but these are few and far between due to what I mentioned above and also the ""just get better numbers"" combat system. Another point is that the games base features have been built and thrown on one at a time by Paradox Interactive's DLC policy which causes large amounts of harm towards the playerbase and game design. Paradox Interactive engages in a policy of building a product with a incomplete foundation and then throwing on additional content to the incomplete foundation. Players who initially get HOI4 (Hearts of Iron IV) without the DLC will see this issue as the game is devoid of large amounts of content. In reality though I believe that while the game is extremely bare in content without DLC the main issue of the game comes from the game mechanics being poorly designed in broken in a rush to make a sellable game (made in 2 and 1/2 years and was extremely buggy on launch). Those players typically will then move on to buy the ridiculously overpriced DLC in a hope to fix their perceived major issue in the game which is there being almost no content outside of the major powers which only had one main option. The main issue of game mechanics has never fixed though and these DLCs simply serve as a content band-aid to distract people from the issue. Paradox continues to take advantage of this crippling issue to further exploit their players into buying further band-aids for this product as people believe that this new DLC along with the others will eventually fix the game. The individual features in the game are not horrible but are not well tied together or are incomplete. Examples with this are the commonly forgot about factory deletion options, certain spy operations, specific naval ships, lack of game options / settings, and a complete lack of any thought towards late game power snowballing. These are more of the easy to spot issues. Majority of the features and mechanics take much longer to uncover the issues from though. So to wrap things up HOI4 can be a fun game at times, I have played this game for over 1,000 hours. BUT HOI4 is a fractured game from perspective of game mechanics and design, Paradox also continues to engage in a major anti-consumer policy of HEAVILY overpriced DLCs. If you disagree with me on the DLC point I recommend looking at DLC prices compared to content and then look at other games DLC policy such as Arma 3 and Fallout New Vegas. There is a major difference in the DLC pricing and policy. In games like New Vegas there was far more content for a lower price (Yes I know New Vegas is an older game but it still released with better pricing) and other games like Arma where there is roughly the same amount of content but it is slightly cheaper and you have a full sandbox and thousands of ways to use that content. If you are looking for a World War 2 global RTS game then I will recommend this BUT only when it is all on a HUGE sale. If you are willing to wait a few years, don't want to spend hours on a save to potentially get a random F U from the game and make you restart, or simply don't want to spend $60+ on a sale then don't play this game. Even though HOI4 is a MAJOR improvement on HOI3 it isn't hard to improve on a $!*% game. (Edited for grammatical purposes.)",Not Recommended,3586.0,"1,351.8 hrs on record",Posted: 26 July

But if you want a game where you can plan military campaigns without using tricks or exploits, then i have to disappoint you. Oh and btw, if you plan on playing one of the axis powers: Don't you ever start in the year 1936. The Allies will have so much troops until the war starts that you can't even get into Belgium or conquer the netherlands. Starting in 1939 it is a piece of cake to beat Belgium, the Netherlands and France. But when you start in 1936. Oh my. Don't even think about it. The only possibility to win when you start this early is to trick the AI by invading the Netherlands and Belgium early on, before the Allies are formed.

The issue here is the new (totally unnecessary) paradox launcher which barely works, often times needing to be restarted, and broke both the game and many mods, and exists seemingly for the sole purpose of forcing players to view ads. The issues it caused with the game seem to have been mostly fixed but the launcher still doesn't work the majority of the time and most of the best mods still don't work and the mod authors can do nothing to fix it because the launcher is the issue. The troubleshooting options available for post launcher mods is the classic ""turn it off and back on"" or unsubscribe from all mods, purge any trace of Hearts of Iron from your computer, reinstall Hearts of Iron, subscribe to the singular mod you want to play, launch the game, and repeat whenever you want to play a different mod. Paradox doesn't seem to care about fixing these problems after months and months widespread complaints and would never consider removing the launcher (That wasn't needed in the first place) because they wouldn't be able to run ads for their own products anymore. $170 for base game plus DLC and paradox broke the only thing that even comes close to justifying that price, if you decide to buy it then get it at a deep discount.",Not Recommended,1180.0,862.1 hrs on record,Posted: 21 March

Since the bastards would not give me my money back, or even talk with me, I decided to give the game some additional time to prove me wrong.

1585,hannibal4366,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hannibal4366/,"Unfortunately not able to recommend this one due to poor UI and controls for land combat. I did not see this in many other reviews. So I thought it would be worth writing it down in a couple of points, as it's a core mechanic of the game, at least for me. I like many other Paradox grand strategy games (EU4, Stellaris, CK), and usually prepare well (reading up on the wiki, tutorials etc) so the complexity was not an issue for me. I bough the game on sale together with one DLC to get the focus tree for the minor nation I wanted to play. The UI is poor at showing useful army information. Like most games of its kind here's a few dozen variables involved in combat. No problem. Unlike other games, however, HOI4 doesn't summarise this in a useful overall ""strength"" indicator (ideally) or really provide any useful information. Armies show a list of divisions with a ""green bar"" and a ""brown bar"" that don't actually tell you anything. The most prominent bit of information on your army is the number of divisions, but sheer numbers matter much less than in other games. As a result most of the game is spent tediously mouse-overing individual divisions to get any real information on combat stats and inputs such as equipment. You cannot directly move your units, you're forced to use AI-assisted ""battle plans"". Without it you miss the large ""planning bonus"" that you need to match defensive entrenchment bonuses. And, following up from the above, the battle plan is the only place that summarises the dozens of variables involved in land combat in a single ""advantage"" or ""disadvantage"" indicator. Battle plan UI is terrible. Battle plans consist of ""front lines"", ""offensive lines"" and ""arrows"" in between. Good luck trying to draw these exactly where you want them. The tools to ""edit"" plans don't work well at all, so you end up hitting the ""delete all orders"" and trying again. This is not helped by the ridiculous complexity of the UI, with ""click"", ""right click"", ""shift click"" and ""control click"" (and even control alt right click!) each having individually essential functions that are different depending on which type of ""line"" you draw or what kind of unit is selected. AI execution of battle plans is uncontrollable. The AI is dumb in executing battle plans. It doesn't coordinate with allied units. It hardly seems to know the composition of your own army (which divisions have better air support, or better attack vs better defence). I don't have an issue with ""dumb"" AI on my own side in games, as long as I can manually override it. But HOI4 has no controls to do so. It only makes things worse: units go back to their AI-assigned positions as soon as they reach the player-assigned spot. In summary I want to point out there's a bunch of negative reviews here that lament the loss of a battles they expected to win (""20 vs 5 divisions!! But I lost!!""). In my view those are symptoms of the UI and controls problems described above. Unit count is just one of many variables, and if you try to just click-and-move to attack on the basis that it's ""20 v 5"" outside of a battle plan you will run into trouble. However that's the intuitive way these games should work - you take the big shiny number the game gives you as an indicator of ""strength"" and try and point-and-click to move your units. That the game chooses to present the wrong number to you, and hides all the others, and that the point-and-click has been wickedly transformed into control alt shift right click whatever, that's a flaw and not a feature, in my view. So what are the redeeming qualities of the game? Why did it get such great professional reviews? For single player, the alternative history flair could be interesting to just watch unfold. For me watching a documentary would be less frustrating than trying to actually play this as a war game where, you know, you actually want to move units in the direction you choose as a player in a way that makes somewhat sense? But perhaps if you treat the game more like a documentary and just sit back and watch it unfold with limited player intervention is entertaining to some. Set difficulty on ""easy"" (or play as a very big easy country / with a big fat AI ally). Just selecting focus, research, and construction, basically, then assign all units to a single big fat front line and click ""go"" and watch it go. I strongly suspect this is how the professional reviewers played it. And if that's your thing, well great for you I don't judge but that's not my cup of tea. I played single player only. I can imagine the above is better in multiplayer, when the coordination with allies is not dependent on the AI, and probably combined with a lot of experience, when you control shift alt right click your battle plans to victory with ease.",Not Recommended,3929.0,24.5 hrs on record,Posted: 25 May

Full of ""ironic"" nazi bros repeating stale memes from 2016, hackers, exploit users, backstabbers and all around ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-talkers who prefer to denigrate new players or anyone else who plays the game ""wrong"" then to be helpful, or cooperative. Single player is awful, stale, and uninteresting. the DLCs do not help this game and just make it more broken and unmanageable. Do you like scrolling through different, irrelevant tabs? Do you like expansions that break previous core mechanics? Do you like boring, stale rinse and repeat ways to win a game because there's no other way except by stacking bombers, fighters, and artillery heavy divisions? Do you like just W A I T I N G for things to happen? then this is the game for you, because you are probably a very passive aggressive person, an all around loser in life, and deserve nothing good to happen to you. It's hurry up and wait in multiplayer lobbies for an hour to start, 2 hours of waiting around doing nothing for something interesting to happen since time is so slow in large multiplayer lobbies. If one thing goes wrong, there's no recovering in a timely fashion and you're stuck waiting several more hours IRL to correct something someone did wrong. Never mind the disconnects, the bad lag from poor optimization the community is forced to fix with their own mods. If you are stupid enough to play this game, instead of doing something productive with your time like going for a walk, doing some calisthenics, learning to code to make a better game than this sorry excuse, or just playing a better game, then I recommend you only play with IRL friends. There's no stranger in multiplayer that you will enjoy meeting that will make this game bearable. Trust me. I've played this game since it released and this latest expansion is the straw that broke the camel's back. Not that it matters, because 4/5th of this game's fanbase is afraid of using any of the content included (no spies, no strategic bombers, no mixed template divisions, no boosting allies' industry if you are a major player, no subs beyond rinky dinky 1936 models, no rockets, and that's on top of the hugbox MP lobbies set up to coddle Axis players because heaven forbid the Allies don't let Italy gobble Yugoslavia in 1938). I can't emphasize how bad this game is. It's a literal waste of time. There's nothing high-brow or intelligent about waiting for production efficiency to be increased by 5.00% in 176 in-game days (that actually takes 1h30 IRL time in MP or 10 minutes at max speed in single) or a naval invasion to take 88 days (40 minutes IRL) to just... PREPARE. Stop being a masochist. Go play a real strategy game instead of an excel sheet with some moving pixels. If you don't believe this review, go browse the youtube commentary section for any popular vid about this game. It's full of cringy, ""heh, this guy only has 83 civilian factories in 1937?

Unlike the proclamations of many mentally deficient and schizophrenic, drug addled fiends, who claim that we will fall in one spectacular motion, as a result of an archaic, remote deities immense wrath, that will not be the case. The end will not occur in a literal sense, with fire and brimstone raining down up us. Instead, our destruction will emerge subtly, gradually eroding the foundations within our society, until we summarily capitulate and fold inwards. In a metaphorical sense, fire and brimstone, as described in the Bible will bombard us, in fact such an assault is being waged against the minds and souls of every inhabitant in our society. The fire is a metaphor for the bright lights that pound incessantly against our skulls, searing our brains and distorting our senses, whilst the brimstone is media indoctrination warping our logicality and ability to cognitively rationalize unique scenarios. By utilizing media, TikTok, Instagram and modern day degenerate memes, they wish to convert us into a decrepit mental state, where we become sluggish and generally apathetic to modern day issues, such as homosexuality, pedophilia, zooiphilia and in general, the LGBTQ. Without intervention and the dismantlement of Jewish media, we will be forced to endure this hardship, wallowing away our woes through self induced drug and alcohol addictions. This is an attempt, concocted through a devilish alliance of George Soros and Waleed Aly from the project. They are conspiring together, to de Anglofy Australian society and plunge our country into a deprave, hedonistic, multicultural sphere, that is devoid of logic. Dear viewer, I ask you now, do you like kebabs white man? Because in the new Jewish and Arab world order, kebabs will constitute the entirety of your diet. No more, will the white man be allowed to eat European foods, such as lamb, or mutton. White foods will become racist and will undoubtedly promote miscegenation and racist ideologies perpetuated by the malignant few. At least, that is what the media will say, they will misconstrue their intent and veil their sinister motions with flowery language and a wave of their paws. I ask you again, do you truly accept how society is devolving? I am the seer of Persia and I will reveal to you the future, if these rabid silly little dumplings succeed in their tyrannical act. By the year of 2040, pedophilia, zoophilia, otherwise regarded as beastiality, incest and live abortions will become an encouraged reality. These, generally perceived degenerate acts are sliding down the same slope, as their predecessors, homosexuality and transgenderism have done. Homosexuality and the other mental illness mentioned were initially condemned in mainstream society, being illegal, with severe repercussions occurring if such a degenerate act was partaken upon. It wasn‚Äôt until the 1940‚Äôs, when Jewish media and mainstream entertainment began subtly pushing the decadent acts that society became more accepting, or to be specific, more apathetic to the previously regarded degenerative behavior . When the time emerged, that homosexuality and transgenderism was campaigned to be legalized , the amount of vehemence towards to the sexual acts was lesser than it was 20 years prior. After several years of homosexuality and transgenderism being instituted and integrated into society, the elites then proceeded to ridicule, arrest and defame anyone who regarded the acts with derision and blatantly disagreed with them. By labeling the dissenters with words such as ‚Äòhomophobic‚Äô or ‚Äòtransphobic‚Äô, the dissent was virtually quashed, as the majority realized that disagreement would mean the loss of their livelihood. To reiterate, this was how homosexuality and transgenderism became integrated into mainstream society. Initially, they were despised and regarded with vehemence, but once media and entertainment intervened, the disapproval faltered. Afterwards, legalization occurred and despite the middle class and lower classes initial disgruntlement, they were majorly apathetic. Then, after a period of 20 or so years passing, the new generation acknowledged and accepted said acts, successfully integrating them into broader, mainstream society. Pedophilia, beastility , incest and live abortions are travelling down the same route. Already, in today's society pedophilia is being subtly encouraged by mainstream media through Netflix movies such as cuties, whilst in other parts of the western hemisphere such as  Canada, beastiality has been legalized according to the supreme court. ¬†Example: In 2016,¬†the¬†Supreme Court of¬†Canada¬†held in R v DLW that¬†Canada's bestiality¬†offences did not prohibit non-penetrative intimacy acts with animals. In regards to incest, by importing the third world, where incest is commonplace, it will soon become normalized , that and the degenerative behavior is normalized by sites such as P*rnh*b. Lastly, for live abortions, they will occur to political adversaries, if the elites are allowed to continue their tyrannical ways, then some day, likely in 2040, political dissidents will be gunned on the street, mercilessly by their overlords. IT IS A REALITY PEOPLE! ANOTHER VICTIM OF BLACK LIVES MATTERS TYRANNY! HOW MUCH LONGER WILL WE ALLOW THESE SAVAGES TO DEFACE OUR WOMAN FOLK? HOW HAS THIS TYRANNY OCCURRED? That is the question most frequently inquired, how has this occurred? Can such an action be repelled? Can society redeem itself and avert nearly inevitable disaster? Most pessimists would shout nay, being adamant that our societies downfall will occur regardless. These pessimists would proclaim as such, whilst simultaneously whiling away their days, watching Basketball Americans shoot hoops, as they masturbate to scantily clad woman. I as the anonymous truth teller, have the courage to disagree, I bear a shred of optimism and exclaim that yes, an alternative can and will emerge. Our woes will be resolved. But only if we unite together as one. I am your true salvation, only if you add me on Steam and Discord, flocking to my banner, will you be able to comprehend the truth and propel our civilization into prosperity.

Anyways here's how to make spaghetti Bolognese: ->Ingredients -olive oil -400g beef mince -400g Italian pork sausages, skinned and crumbled -200g smoked pancetta -1 onion, finely chopped -1 carrot, finely chopped -2 celery sticks, finely chopped -4 garlic cloves, chopped -1 sprig thyme -small bunch fresh basil, small leaves picked and reserved -2 bay leaves -2 tsp dried oregano -handful dried porcini mushrooms -1 tsp golden caster sugar -1 tbsp tomato pur√©e -¬Ω tsp Thai fish sauce -1 tbsp red wine vinegar -100ml whole milk -4 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes -200ml white wine -100g parmesan, grated, rind removed and kept -spaghetti, to serve ->Method STEP 1: Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan and crumble in the mince and sausagemeat. Spend a good 30 mins cooking the mince ‚Äì it will release lots of liquid, which you want to evaporate, and then eventually it will end up sizzling in its own fat. If the pan becomes too dry, drizzle in a little more olive oil. Towards the end, continue stirring the mince until it becomes speckled with crisp brown bits. STEP 2 Heat oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 2. While the mince is browning, heat a drizzle more oil in a casserole dish and sizzle the pancetta for 5 mins until it starts to brown and release its fat, then throw in the vegetables and herbs, and finely crumble over the dried porcini. Cook gently for 5 mins until soft and starting to brown. Sprinkle over the sugar, then stir in the tomato pur√©e and splash in the fish sauce and vinegar. Simmer down until gloopy, then stir through the meat and pour in the milk and tomatoes. Rinse out the tomato tins with the wine and stir into the pan. Season, then nestle in the parmesan rind. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook in the oven for 3 hrs. STEP 3 When cooked, tip as many portions of Bolognese as you need into a saut√© pan. Cook the pasta until very al dente, then tong into the pan with a bit of the water and finish cooking with the sauce for 2 mins. Stir through the parmesan and a drizzle more olive oil. Twirl the pasta and Bolognese into bowls, scatter with basil and serve with more parmesan. Enjoy!",Recommended,1760.0,199.6 hrs on record,Posted: 16 August

It sucks you in and offers all kinds of possibility, but this is all surface differences. Every play through is the same. The AI is dumb, and because of this the game gives it advantages. They mass produce divisions and move faster than the game makes it possible for a player to move. Even when Germany is scraping the bottom of the barrel for manpower it's a slog for the UK.

There's a great selection of mods such as RT56 and Kaiserreich that greatly improves the gameplay by adding detailed focus trees to a lot of countries and creating alternate history scenarios. The downsides to HOI4 has to be the DLC's. They're stupid expensive for what they are. Having all of them improves gameplay however paying $28 for a basic DLC that should have been included in the base game is stupid and you should only buy them from ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• or on sale.

Between ghost files preventing you from re-downloading, to mods not appearing after 3 re-installs of the game, to installed and activated mods not working; the launcher as killed the best part of the game. Have fun getting QoL mods working when you can't see them half the time and they don't actually activate the rest. Enjoy playing identical games with your friends because you can't install extra focus trees or overhauls. I have an unhealthy amount of time in this game and enjoyed a lot of it.

First of all the game doesn't explain ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to you so you better flip out internet and youtube guides if you event want to play it. Then my most major problem is that several systems are extremely overdesigned, like naval combat, while other things like economics, supply, diplomacy are a hollow shell of a feature. War and related diplomacy is as bad as in any Paradox game with unreasonable design choices, incomprehensible mechanics and a promise of a sandbox that it never delivers. The whole claims mechanics is just as bad as in all their games, even diplomacy where it would make tremendous sense to actually allow player to negotiate territorial claims give and take territories or promise certain lands to allies in exchange for help is non-existent. The only settlement you can make is locked in a research tree instead of actual diplomacy, you can't demand certain territories you'd like to demand just because f. u. it is locked in another subsystem. The brutal oversimplification of all economics and logistics is just a crime IMO, the whole war was decided by those factors leaving them out is borderline retarded. Trade also has almost nothing to do with diplomacy where it was totally interconnected. Trade and resource availability practically doesn't matter, it's just another subsystem that is extremely underdesigned and poorly integrated. You can't pressure minor powers into doing something if it's not on the national focus tech tree. Another miss on the diplomacy part, whereas you should be able to pressure minor powers to for example open up their ports or give you the oil instead of someone else... with an ""or else"" statement! Having war support without the actual possibility and/or need to balance civilian needs with military doesn't make any sense. Your people won't starve, won't die, won't be overworked, they don't suffer if they aren't bombed, they just exist to fill the manpower bar.

Yes, I know fans of the genre will jump at my throat for saying it but I didn't have a single second of fun in it whatsoever. I think Age of Empires, the closest game to this one I played so far is superior in every single way. I mean you don't have to have a bloody theses in history and be a genius to enjoy it casually. Also, there is this thing called tutorials in that game, there are some in this game too but they might as well not be as to how confusing they are. Overall, a highly unwelcome experience for a beginner and it will make you feel like an idiot trying to understand how to make some bloody army and resources.

Naval combat has been revamped, but AI or computer decision making is still broken.  The AI decides to make outdated or old ships late game when it should be making newer ships to make the game more challenging.  Even with community mods the game still does not function like it could be designed to. The army ai is also broken.  The army system works by creating a line of troops around the front of the battle between you and your enemy.  The computer or ai does not make lines properly to even be a little challenging.  The ai pulls troops from the line constantly to make it so easy to just conquer territory through the opening or the ai does not put anything other than infantry on the line against your heavy tanks that destroy the enemy infantry. The game really has all the pieces to be a good challenging game, but paradox interactive will not fix the ai or computer.  This has not just happened recently either.

2093,SentryGunMainMan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SentryGunMainMan/,"Basic Start to the HoI4 Experience I may not have played much, but speaking of the first experience i had, and the experiences from other paradox games. This is definitely one of the most enjoyable ( and simpler) games paradox has made. [hl] Good things[/hl] Some good things about the game is that it is not too hard to get the hang of.  Yes, at first glance it does look complicated, but most of it is pretty easy to get the hang of and can be really fun. The controls are pretty simple, like most other RTS and Grand Strategy Games. The wars are really enjoyable, and especially satisfying to win.  The different types of warfare to have, not to mention the different types of games to play. The fact is no matter what, your choices affect the game.  Shaping it.  One annexed nation here could stop a whole historical event from happening or just make it happen sooner.  The open ability to change the course of the game is very nice and really opens up some interesting game paths. The units are really nice as well, they are easy to have a more automated push into enemy territory than in other games, where you have to physically move each unity or group to attack a certain objective.  In here, you can set a battle plan, giving your troops a more open way to attack and conquer. The infrastructure in the game are very important when playing.  Always make sure to balance the civilian with the military factories. This game is always enjoyable with friends, and can be really wacky when you all are forging your own paths. The game itself is relatively small on size, so it can be played on many devices without a worry of taking all of the storage space. Downsides Unfortunately, like any game it has some downsides. 1. The price is way to high, I get that with this game you don't have to have a DLC to make it fun, but the fact that its 40 dollars just seems like too much.   I would say lower it by 25-50% of the price.  To at least make it more affordable.  Especially since there are quite a few DLC. 2. The path finding rules might need to be updated a bit, sometimes your units don't take a route over water when you want them to.  It might have just been me, but I feel that if there was an easier time clicking on the other dock you want them to go to, they could take a sea route instead of land. 3. The graphic requirements are a little on the high side, but can be turned down 4.  Same with the RAM requirements, while it may not seem like a lot, it does use quite a bit of RAM to run smoothly on multiplayer. 5. Need a good internet connection.  From what I can tell to do multiplayer well without the game slowing down you need at least around 50mbps.  This is from what I found out on my experiences.  It could vary by player. I recommend you and your friends get LogMeIn Hamachi.  It helps with the connection issues a bit by giving a more direct connection to your friends game. I recommend this for all games, not just HoI4 I'm sure there are more downsides to some people, but these are the few I found annoying. Overall It's a good game, a little pricey, but just wait for it to go on sale and you can enjoy the thrill of war too.",Recommended,2544.0,337.9 hrs on record,Posted: 17 March

It is not entertaining to engage with a system that either doesn't require taught or isn't complimenting the main focus of the game. Also other big issue of this game is that when you reach the endgame it grinds to a halt.

See, the idea of WW2 as a day-by-day RTS sounds really good. However, for the first 4 years of the game, you'll only do something every 70 days. The focus tree. Which barely does anything most of the time. Mods understand this is stupid because most mods have focus trees with less time in between focuses. However, the other biggest problem is the combat. Gods above, is the combat in this game atrocious. Numbers is how every single combat is decided. Which is fine, but it's not engaging. You draw a line and press go. If you have better tech and a better set up, you win. What's the problem? That's the most engaging part of the game. I kid you not. Don't expect the country building or """"""Diplomacy"""""" to be more engaging. Both are a joke and if you never did either, depending on the country, you could win if you never even found the button to do either. I've played a lot of this game, mostly with conversion mods, but I can honestly say that's because you can play this game minimized while doing homework or reading. And don't get me started on the multiplayer, which is the most egregious part of this game. Want to waste an entire afternoon? Play as America in a friendly multiplayer game and watch Russia and the UK lose to Germany before you even enter the war.

2154,starfleet1701,https://steamcommunity.com/id/starfleet1701/,"I played this on vanilla, I understand the DLCs change alot. However, I'm not going to spend an additional 20 bucks or so on DLCs. The game is fun but, theres alot of things about this game that ruins it for me. Here positives and the negatives. For those who dont know this game is based on the 2nd World War, you get to basically relive the events of it as a leader of a nation rather than a field commander commanding an army or a fleet. Positives: 1. Graphics are very nice and the game does seem to be very detailed to the point where they add weather affects in different parts of the world that would affect your forces. 2. Game is very realistic to the point of where you have to equip your troops and train them like produce the necessary equipment for them and transports for them. 3. Having the ability to play as a smaller country is kind of nice. 4. In the settings you can certainly have countries behave to where you can reenact a ""what if"" scenario. 5. Some tech that can be researched wont be available until a later year. This is nice because it means that the player wont come out with Iowa class battleship in 1937  at the beginning of the game (though I've done this before, lol) 6. Units in this game are actual units not just like a single soldier. So, what I mean is that in most Strategy games the troops are called units. In reality units are actually regiments, brigades, companies, platoons, divisions, corps', etc. In this game all troops are organized into divisions. ( which a single division typically has about roughly 15k troops, that's according to NATO standards) Negatives: 1. This game is incredibly complicated, and the tutorial explains nothing. 2. National focus and research trees are very overwhelming, (I played a few games with a no air force mod which, really helps condenses it and make it less overwhelming.) 3. combat in this game sucks, (now bear in mind this is vanilla gameplay so, DLCs might change a few things). Combat is so bad that I've had 45 armor divisons up against 1 Japanese infantry division. organization is all good and equipment is good. Dispite all this all 45 divisions fail to break through  a single infantry division. I don't care how much fortifications that 1 division has there is no way in hell a single infantry division can stand up against 45! 4. The AI  is just absolutly garbage and the historical settings doesn't work! I played 2 games with historical AI setting on. Dispite this, France goes Communist in the first game I was like WTF? I quit the game start a new one. During the new game; France, once again, goes Communist. Then Britain also goes Communist and hell even Canada goes communist. 5. This game likes to pride itself on historical realism, but they kind fail in this regard. Heavy cruisers in this game are classified as capital ships. In reality Heavy Cruisers were NOT classified as capital ships the only ships that were classified as capital ships were: Battleships, battle cruisers and Carriers. Another thing was the fake ships they have for research. Like Illinois class. This is completely fictional there were no class of ships that were named Illinois to be better armed or armored than the Iowa class. Also Virginia class? why would the game name it that way when in the description they said its the South Dakota 1920s design. Why not just call it the South Dakota then? 6. Troops don't seem to not want to move when told to do so. When the game's on play sometimes I find my divisions just, for some reason refuse to move. Or move to a completely different place when I didn't tell them to move to, their organization is completely fine. So, because of this really weird thing, the divisions that did move do their job; but. Without reinforcements they get completely wiped out. So, there were times when I lost 24 divisions because I had back up units refused to actually move to the designated area and instead go somewhere totally random. ( again bear in mind this is the vanilla game so this might've been fixed with the DLCs) So, what do I think of this game overall? Well it was fun at first. However: divisions not doing their dam jobs, AI doing some really crazy things, extremely complicated and overwhelming game play with a useless tutorial. Really turns me off, which I'm extremely disappointed. I love historical strategy games, but this one just turns me away. So, I feel like I waisted my $10 on this game that's an uninstall for me. Note: This is my first time playing a Hearts of Iron game. So, I've never played any of the other previous games. Also again, understand I played the vanilla game so no DLCs.",Not Recommended,3800.0,484.9 hrs on record,Posted: 5 June

2171,76561198069975174,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198069975174/,"After ~130 hours in the game, I feel like I have enough experience to speak a little on it. While the core concept of HOI4 is fun, it faces several gameplay issues that make it not only unreasonably difficult to play, but also heavy on the micro-managing end. In concept, it's fun. The idea of playing as any nation during the era of WW2 and rewriting history is incredibly tantalizing. Steering any nation down an alternate path - whether it be Communist America, Fascist UK, or any number of kings and queens as well as democracies - is fun as hell. The problem, though, comes with war. Without going into excessive detail, there are many gameplay mechanics that make war extremely frustrating to deal with. Having to micro-manage your armies due to big orders that simply don't work is very annoying. Not to mention, many of the national focus trees (the political path you take your nation down) often fall flat, due to most of the interesting ones putting your nation at odds or war with superpowers and overwhelming odds. To many players, this challenge makes the game that much more fun. Which is why I can't really recommend you buy or don't buy as a general rule. It depends on your playstyle and what type of sandbox you want to play. To me, I like a moderate challenge but for the most part, the RP and immersive experience is much more important. Long story short, you'll love the game if you're the type of strategy player that likes to micro-manage and find the best possible meta to completely dominate with. If you're like me, though, where you just like creating your own nation and getting into the experience of it all, you'll find the game very frustrating. It will feel like you can't see your plans come to fruition due to the heavy difficulty barrier the game has.",Not Recommended,1469.0,251.8 hrs on record,Posted: 4 March

The gameplay is laden with mindless research and resource clicking and it distracts from the focus of the game - warfare. The battles, when they do eventually come, are long, drawn out, and haphazard at best. The battle units must be assigned to a commander and given battle orders and then the AI will execute it. This hands off approach is rather frustrating since the AI will behave in mysterious ways - units being pulled from battles and reassigned to the rear leaving in-battle units to be slaughtered. Further adding salt to the wound is that units are given bonus points for being assigned a commander, meaning, if you detach from the AI commander and fight the battle yourself, you'll get penalized and find yourself losing by a landslide. Overall, it's beautiful game with lovely graphics. However, the hands-off approach cripples the game's strategic element and instead leaves you with a lot to be desired while you're mindlessly clicking away.",Not Recommended,882.0,7.8 hrs on record,Posted: 11 March

Add new mechanics for Spanish civil war that make you wish it was just like the old system because they forced you into a clicky game that feels pointless since everything you do just becomes undone and only the national focus make any real difference. just some examples.

The way resourse harvesting and constructing works is also really retarted, instead of just it steadily producing a resource, this game gives you the option to prioritize and do other things that I still to this day have no idea what it does.

2328,Bertania,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Bertania/,"Out of all the games I've played recently this has to be the worst one.  Or at least close to the worst.  Before I get into the biggest point on why this game just isn't good I'll explain a few gripes I personally don't like.  Mainly the tutorial.  It's horrible.  One of the worst tutorials I've ever done.  It basically only shows you how to fight a war with units and that's it.  They show you only how to do a small section of the game.  Many many times when you need to do something in a regular game it'll show you a tool tip if you don't know how or what to do.  But the tool tip will either be a link to the wiki, or a video on how to do it.  That's even worse than the actual tutorial.  The game very clearly expects people to either do so much research into external sources on how to play the game, or expects people who played the earlier games to just know. Now to the actual game.  It's fine.  Not great, but not very good either.  It feels like a weird mix of Civ games but RTS.  I personally find it weird, but many people probably won't.  The main issue I have with the actual gameplay when you're done reading 500 pages of the wiki or 40 hours of the video tutorials is that not a whole lot happens.  Regardless of when an actual war starts, not much is really going on.  You do some research every so often, you upgrade the political path to get bonuses and unlock more things, you train units for army, you trade with other countries, make political decisions, work on your factories needed, among many other small things.  There's a lot of small things that aren't particularly ""fun"" to do between the actual fun part which is doing the actual strategy part with wars and political tension.  So I'd say about 10% of the game for me is fun.  Other people may like these other aspects but I personally don't. Lastly I do want to mention the horrible design choice by the developers.  Currently as of me writing this, this game is $18 on Humble Bundle for base game and all dlc, it's $1 for just base game.  The problem with whichever version you get is that even with the great value of all the dlc's, without the dlc's this game is very very bare bones.  There's barely any polish on it and lacks a lot of features present in previous games.  So the $1 version is cheap and probably worth it tbh, you will always be playing an inferior game since the devs decided features should be locked behind a paywall.  I don't care how good the game is with or without the dlc.  That's scummy.  No one should support that, even if it's a good price.  If I didn't have a key I used for this I would refund it. TL;DR It's an alright but very flawed game and the part with the scummy dlc is just horrendous. 4/10 if you paid full price. 5/10 if you got a discount.",Not Recommended,2214.0,4.0 hrs on record,Posted: 10 August

Use national focuses to guide your nation in the direction you want, but be prepared for the consequences of changing history. Theres nothing like opening a can of whoop ass by creating deadly army groups with the proper equipment and width to achieve the most unlikely of victories. Naval actions and Air Combat prove to be satisfying every single time. When they accompany your conquests you can feel the support to your armies, and therefore when comes the lack of support you will also feel the hurt (especially if you have no air force or navy to speak of from the start). This game for me was easy to learn and hard to master, at 260 hours, i just got to a point where im comfortable going to war with Germany, the Soviets, and the British (not all at once obviously).

2390,Ylang-Ylang,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ylang-Ylang/,"Hearts of Iron IV is a dumbed down successor to Hears of Iron III. A game for inbred brain dead casuals, that are incapable of thinking, and when asked what is 2+2 they say it's racism, turtle, and a potato! Playing both games, and having XXX hours in them, maybe even XXXX I know what I'm talking about. HoI3 wasn't perfect, it had it's flaws, and everyone knows it, but it had depth, it had climate, authenticity, and a lot of content, features that HoI4 doesn't, still 5 years after the release, and will never have. It's quite similar to Crusader Kings 2, and the dumbed down Crusader Kings 3. Paradox does it every single time. Skip this garbage, and get Hearts of Iron 3, you'll enjoy it much more, unless you are a casual, then get Hearts of Iron 4. I don't really know where to start, as those games are so different in many aspects. First of all the Order of Battle creation... gone. The best, and most important feature of the game. Researching certain parts of the vehicles. In Hoi3 you had 4 parts they consisted of which were armor/engine/gun/reliabilty... gone*. In HoI4 you research whole vehicles at once, and just that. It kills a lot of authenticity, in fact it removes it, HoI4 is just so poorly done, there's no authenticity, or any world war climate, it feels more like a board game, so simplified even a chimpansee would be able to conquer Europe, or China. It felt great how you built your vehicles to your liking, how every part had a correct name, how your initial builds were being upgraded with better cannons, armor etc. Now in HoI4, it looks like, research > Panzer 3 > research completed, research > Panzer 4 > research completed... it's so awfull. I expected Hearts of Iron 4 to be bigger, better, even more expanded, realistic, and complicated, as that what I enjoyed the most, the way it was made, and how it worked. They just scrapped the best parts of their game, and remade it... for who I don't know. The research itself is gone as we know it, now all you do is follow some ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• linear trees, and doctrines with decisions, which for me is just so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• stupid I can't even, I just can't. In HoI3 beside some decisions on a national level, pretty much every country could be built the same way, had pretty much access to the same things, the only difference were levels of research, and that was fine by me, it was realistic, and just nicely done, while HoI4 has gone full ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, trees are full of ahistorical, fantasy crap, because that's what this game become, ""what if"", some sort of ahistorical blasphemy. You can of course select historical AI to play, but still, what has Paradox done to this game is just beyond me. At least there are modders, and if I was ever to buy Hearts of Iron 4, I would only buy it for the Black Ice mod, I loved it in the Hearts of Iron 3, and loved it in HoI4, but I won't be buying the game, because it's quite ridiculous to buy a game that I have no interest in, just to play an amazing masterpiece mod. I'd rather wish those guy/girls whoever made it, made their own game, and I would gladly pay them, as Black Ice is what Hears of Iron should have always been. We can't forget about the Paradox DLC madness, how HoI4 at a release was just a sandbox game, though with no sand at all, and every DLC [cut out content of the base game] is in fact a bit of sand that gets added to the sandbox itself. Too long didn't read? Get Hearts of Iron 3 with all expansions + try Black Ice mod. Get Hears of Iron 4 with whatever is required to run Black Ice mod. Otherwise don't bother. * I forgot you can build variants, which are similar to how it worked in HoI3, but it's all about numbers, add +1 number to certain type of upgrade. After building variants, you can't even delete them in the game, but hide... 2021 and you can't even remove a mod.",Not Recommended,3101.0,8.0 hrs on record,Posted: 10 March

Hearts of Iron specifically deals with the WW2 era, obviously. As a result, it features greater emphasis on frontline warfare and integrated war-goods production than the other games, and a diminished emphasis on internal politics, or meaningful change over time.

The game is complicated and overwhelming at first. It will take hours before you understand the base mechanics of the game. The games take hours on their own. Multiplayer is possible but if everyone doesn't have a strong computer the game will be slow for everyone. With all of that said, I am very thankful I bought this game.

Strongly recommend the game, does require the DLC to be playable however. If you're going to buy the DLC, I recommend the following, ignore the rest. -Battle for the Bosporus -La Resistance -Man the Guns -Waking the Tiger -Death or Dishonor -Together for Victory General Info 4 Main ideologies Democracy - Op occupation laws - Can't attack a nation without a dedicated focus, requires the nation to create world tension to attack them. Non Aligned - Similar to Democracy, less restrictive. Fascist - Can attack create a casus belli at will, few restrictions, unique occupation options, when at war with a major, they can justify against another country extremely fast. Communist - Can justify similar to Fascist, has a unique occupation type too, also can puppet nations for cheaper cost in the peace deals. Aspects you should be aware of - bare these in mind and it will pay you dividends later You have several resources Political Power - Use to change aspects of your cabinet and economic laws, also used to justify and for certain decisions Stability - Increases production and political power when over 50%, decreases it when below. War Support - Quicker mobilization and is required to change certain laws - Just more industry basically Manpower - The amount of raw manpower you have, based on your population and current laws, you get it from occupation too, however with a 98% penalty Equipment - Made via factories - ranging from weapons to support equipment to artillery to planes to tanks ect, it's generally quite simple, however appears complex when you're new. Factory output = 4.5 * efficiency (This increases the longer it's producing the same item) ""Can also be increased via tech"" If an item requires 4.5 to make 1, at 100% efficiency one factory would produce 1 per day. Actual resources - Oil - Aluminum - Rubber - Tungsten - Steel - Chromium - They're naturally located around the globe, can be increase up to *2 via 10 infrastructure, can also be increased again by 1.5* via excavation tech. Required to produce basically everything Focus trees - basically what makes most countries unique, gives them a few major options and goals, this is a focal point of the game Combat types Land - Using front-lines via generals, you create a front line order and attack plan, then command the general to commence the order. They have stats which increase based on their actions, they also increase with a higher likelihood if you give them traits that are relevant to that stat. Soft Attack - how many attack they can make Breakthrough - how many attack they can avoid when attacking Defence - how many attacks they can avoid when defending Hardness - Soft attacks do damage to soft - Hard attacks do damage to hard - If you have a unit that's 90% hard, and it's against a division that only have soft attacks, it will negate 90% of their damage, this is how tanks wreck infantry, they also have very high breakthrough. Air - Air superiority allows you to drastically reduce the enemies defence and breakthrough, it also allows you to bomb their industry unmolested, it's also required to drop nukes. Paratroopers - air superiority also allows you to drop paratroopers in a given country, allowing you to quickly force them to surrender, or divert troops to counter. Naval - If you wish to attack via sea and or destroy their supply and resource chains, you need naval supremancy, or you can spam subs, it's your choice, many even after thousands of hours don't understand it, and don't care to. The only thing you do need to understand is naval invasions, you require naval supremacy for only a brief moment to naval invade ""hint"". Essentially required to invade nationals via sea, and allows you to control the worlds resources via harassing convoys. These are just some basic things to note, when you start, you'll likely have no clue what you're doing, just play and have fun, don't expect to win when you start, and don't be afraid to play as the major nations, you'll learn the most and have the most fun playing them. Experiment and learn the basics, also don't bother with achievements until you understand the game at a basic level, turn ironman mode off, or you'll be constantly restarting and ruin the game for yourself. Additional Trade laws - Increases or decreases resources to market, can be accepted by players and ai, they'll give you a civilian factory for every 8 of the resource you give, as soon as they stop trading it you lose the factory. It's possible to export lots but no country buys due to having low trade relations with them, this is impacted by ideology, relations and literal distance. Mods - this game has some of the best mods I've ever experienced in any game, and really works well with them. Recommend music mods too (Just examples) German March Collection Wolfenstein Music Classical Music Kaisserreich Music Old World Blues Radio Axis Speeches Some full game changing mods that I recommend - ""Kaisserreich + Old World Blues"" (Try both on their own) Recommend trying after around a 100h or so of the base game, they're really good. Just some basics, you've done well if you've read this far, i'll update this at a later date and correct any errors ect...

Simple, At times, there is so much going on that you need to focus your attention on production, politics, war, research, you army, airforce, navy, generals, trade goods, construction, infrastructure that you may need 2 or 3 more people to help you keep up during a heavy engagement. Watch some YouTube or Twitch videos and see for yourself. This game is never the same game twice. You can choose the difficulty levels and have the AI focus on historical or non-historical progression. This game is a challenge. My only concern is that some of the DLC's should come ""FREE"" in an update because their content is mostly cosmetic. Paradox has a winner here.

But, if you like grand strategy, history, world war 2, alternate history theories, co-op, or generally playing something however you'd like, give this game time, and I suspect you will love it. I was completely bamboozled by the game for so long and even with my 850+ hours, I still get confused with how things work and continue to learn the game. Trust me anyone reading this, this game is really good. The dlc is expensive, but it does add a lot of flavor to it and I'd say significantly increases the fun and creativity within it.

Very simplified compared to other HOI games but it can be a challenge nonetheless. The graphics are good however the game will get slower and slower when you're into at least the 40s. The Germans are a good way to start off and get used to the game they're the easiest country to play as. Managing your army is fairly easy and I've found few problems with them. Industry is devoted to construction of factories (Civilian, Military and Dockyards), Forts, Naval Bases (for storing Ships) Industry (For increasing supplies and resources), Handling consumer goods and others. To give the run down on Laws and Government you can choose Conscription laws. Mobilisation laws, trade laws and People you want to add to your cabinet E.G Silent Workhorse. You can also choose Research companies to decrease research times on a specific thing E.G Weapons and Artillery. Military staff will give you buffs for specific things. E.G Infantry National Focuses can give you territory political power increase the popularity of political ideologies and much more. Generic Focus Trees will often do the same but you won't have any Territorial Expansion one's.

Okay here we go: There is a downside in that Hearts of Iron IV has got a steep learning curve. It isn't exactly the easiest game to get into or learn - and the tutorials suck. It's so much easier learning through continued play or watching 3rd party tutorials on something like YouTube. Then again, all Hearts of Iron games have been complex, as are the majority of strategy games nowadays anyway, so it's not anything new. The other downside is the DLCs. The DLCs tend to add content which should've been in the game to begin with. Worse off, they overcharge for the DLC - you basically pay full price for a game in just one or two DLCs. Now the positives. Firstly, some of the DLC content is good. Particularly, I like Man the Guns DLC best, La Resistance the least - although others will disagree. From what I've gathered talking to many HOI players is that there is always that one DLC someone likes the most. It'll depend entirely on you and your tastes though. Second positive is replayability. Each game can go somewhat differently, even playing the same nation. If that doesn't tickle your interest, there is quite a few nations you can play, some easy and some hard. If that still wasn't enough base game replayability for you, you can make things even more random by turning historical AI off completely. And let's not even get started on mods - more to come on those below. Third positive is the great workshop contents, i.e mods, for the game. There is literally a mod out there for everyone: from the First World War to My Little Pony, Alternate History to Meme Mods. The top mods are The Great War [WWI], Kaiserreich & Kaiserredux [both ""What Ifs""], RoadTo56 [Expanded WWII], and Millenium Dawn [Modern Day], although there is mods for Cold War, Napoleonic Wars and more. The mods are almost endless, I have no doubt you'll find something you like there. These mods make the game infinitely replayable, as you can have something different each time. The third postive is graphics. Game looks good. Looks much better than Hearts of Iron III in terms of map design. The UIs are nice, as are the settings - particularly the option to disable NATO unit symbols if you are more casual and don't know what those mean. Overall, I would rate this game 87/100. Many great things about it - if you can learn to play it.",Recommended,1993.0,583.3 hrs on record,Posted: 1 August

3483,76561198027257277,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027257277/,"All right. Time for an honest review of this game! 350hrs into this piece would not be possible if I hated it since the beginning, at least not for me. Gameplay; You will manage resources a lot in the beginning, dismantle ineffective troops, prepare your economy for the war machine, build factories etc - you won't have ""money"" as we know it in this game, it is all about ore and oil. To make sure your future vehicles, boats and airforce is even able to perform you have to make sure there is enough fuel to carry them into victory and beyond. You will be clicking a lot in this game, manage units, add suitable generals and admirals to lead them, perpare your navy for patrols or whatever you need for the moment and keep an eye on diplomatic matters between your neighbours. Those who has read history about ww2 will obviously know in general what to expect - but there is an option to deviate from history if you so wish for it, in the menu. Beginner friendly? No. You will need to invest time in order to get what you can do to make the mechanics tick in your favour. Great lategame? To be honest, the endgame is sometimes quite boring or a chore depending on what you want to do. If you want to paint the map in your colours, prepare for extremely long-winded sessions. If you want to make sure you survive with a decent nation after ww2 has passed - then in my opinion, it is fun and lasts long enough. Summary; This game will suck hours of your life, make you plan your approach in your sleep or think how to make sure the fuel will last the war while you are in bed with your wife. You know... Important matters. Hrm *cough* Anyways. I say this game is great but at the same time has serious flaws. The problems; 1; Drawing the frontline can be ""problematic"", sometimes your army will behave truly strange, units are running back and forth like ants everytime any frontline has been pushed, wasting fuel and ppl running back and forth in enemy territory doesn't seem to have happened in the real war, you want to save the fuel as much as possible, only using it to take objectives. This running back and forth in the frontline without any real goal annoys me, especially when it sometimes leave the frontline wide open for enemy engagements without any units to stop them from your side. Problem number 2; Diplomacy.... what diplomacy? No talks are even possible at any point in the game, there is only total war, either you win over them all or the war never ends. It is stupid in my honest opinion how impossible any peacetalks are in this game. Diplomacy in ww2 did in fact exist. So why not in this game? Either way, you can simply see it this way; win the war completely or you will never have an end to it. 3; All units are the same. No matter which nation you play, your army will perform the same as the germans or the americans, even if you play the japanese. The game will provide identical numbers for your guns performance. Which is odd, looking at history how the weaponry of the nations during ww2 did perform very differently. While the americans and the germans could trust their guns, the japanese and chinese did not have the same quality at all. So when you play the japanese or the chinese, and research small arms - you will notice how your units will perform just the same as the germans or american divisions. The same for the Russians - meaning if you play Russia, you will easily find ways to make sure your army will perform just as well as the germans before the war breaks out. You can have your elite soldiers, removing the trash and holding the lines fine against the germans if you made sure your divisions have the supplies you need. 4; Some dlc's makes the game worse. From what I understand, the La resistance will make the game prolong unnecessarily long. This dlc also makes it unbalanced - just check the discussions on this topic, ppl were quite upset with this content being added into the game. I never bought this for that reason, thus I can't mention any strong points, I can only suggest you check a DLC guide to navigate your wallet's future. Waking the Tiger is a dlc I can strongly recommend if you are curious of the asian theater. I still recommend this game despite the frustrations it will give you. The hours I've put into this game for my entertainment is far cheaper and more fun than most games in the long run. Will you make it into the new world after ww2? I did and I did it as the chinese Emperor! that was fun.",Recommended,3648.0,354.5 hrs on record,Posted: 30 July

With all DLCs added to the base game, all major nations and many of the minors during the WWII era (1936-1948) has a unique and specific focus tree for their nation. And with the DLCs, you can choose to remain historical or have fun with the world and go crazy. Make the Confederate States of America return? Sure, why not. Restore the German Empire under Kaiser Wilhelm II? Absolutely! Turn the Empire of Japan into a communist power and dominate East Asia with China? What could go wrong?!

As a player who couldn't really afford DLC's, I still recommend HOI4 for its vast and amazing modding community. If you like grand-strategy games, HOI4 is definitely up there. The base game holds up in my experience, although I do know that some DLC's do help in improving one's experience, so if you do have a couple of bucks to spare, and you do love it, I'd say it's worth it. (but bear in mind, the lack of DLCs don't really matter that much for me, maybe it'd apply to you as well) And hey, if you're not interested in the base game, you could look towards the aforementioned modding community for even more stuff to do, want to play in alternate timelines?

3700,76561199068045950,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199068045950/,"Glad you asked. Overall I love the game, however, here are my issues. When playing Germany historically one must conduct an ""offensive war"" and this lowers their ""war support"" number for each country they overrun. Every country German attacks they progressively lose war support and then this starts obstructing policy things they can do. This is unrealistic. I, therefore, suggest adding into the gaming algorithm ""war support"" gain every-time  Germany or someone else successfully conquers a country to reflect Hitler's growing popularity. For example, he achieved one of his popularity peaks when France fell in 1940 and returned to Berlin a conquering hero. Conquering the Balkans in April 1941 also further boosted it. There was also shock among the German populous when they attacked the USSR in 1941, but with the initial sweeping military successes morale dramatically increased until the setbacks in December 1941. Of course, as the Allies capture occupied territory their ""war support"" should equally rise. The second issue I have with the game in Great Britain'a ability to rapidly rebuild their army after France gets overrun in 1940 and literally launch large scale counter invasions by early 1941 against occupies France. I've literally destroyed the BEF (meaning no Dunkirk) and within six months they're invading France with dozens of divisions. - in addition to fighting in North Africa and Abyssinia. Large scale amphibious invasions are complicated things not easily done by divisions just created one week earlier. This is unrealistic. Their ability to rebuild a battle effective army needs to be toned-down some. They didn't have that historic capability. Otherwise, I think you people have a hit on your hands and I love the game.",Recommended,1474.0,316.4 hrs on record,Posted: 26 July

Your industrial capacity is the major resource of the game, measured in factories. Whoever has played the tabletop Axies and Allies will get this. Along with this, the ""focus"" system is a really nice implement, as it allows to take certain political paths that will make easier certain aspects during the mid and late game (for example, being a totalitarian fascist or communist makes faster the process of going and fighting wars while democracies are better at other things, as long as the so-called non-aligned system) It is well worth getting DLCs in order to play certain countries, such as Spain, Turkey or the Chinese warlords as it makes them more deep and interesting. The vanilla versions of most countries are very lame sometimes. The major problem of this game is that is way too focused on the military aspect. Is not a usual Paradox Grand Strategy in the sense that you are, in this case, way too attached to a very specific historic event, the 2WW, making almost all your decision about participating in it, or avoiding it, and fighting the actual war can be really difficult, with a lot of small mechanics hard to grasp And here is where we come to another major problem. This has a very pronounced learning curve. It requires constant replays in order to just grasps the basics, and good part of getting good at it is getting yourself familiarized with the different mechanics and processes of all the major countries in Historic mode, so it's quite time consuming. You maybe start to truly enjoy it after your first 100 hours, so be aware of this. That level of difficulty, as it happens with other Paradox Titles, is related to the fact that is complex, deep, and therefore enjoyable for those that actually like these aspects in a game. Is still being worked on, with new content released regularly, the developers seem to be very obsessed with resurrecting past monarchies for some reason, and too focused in alt-history scenarios that are too far from the main historic plot. In my opinion, is fun trying to win as republican Spain or conquer India with Japan, but some other scenarios are way too divergent, specially considering that the average campaign is 5 to 10 years.

For instance, the USSR is a a major player in WW2. One of the 5 majors actually (Germany, Japan, UK, USA, USSR), yet it's focus tree is so lacking that basically nothing happens if ""Trotsky Returns"" to power. He doesn't have his own tree. There are no special mechanics attached. Pretty much just a picture change. I would think that having Trotsky as a leader vs. Stalin during WW2 would have been some sort of difference. Basically the same goes for all of the 5 majors. Lazy work by the devs. I want to love HOI4, but this is just unacceptable when focus trees are easy manipulations to make to the game and they can add very good immersion/flavour.",Not Recommended,687.0,146.5 hrs on record,Posted: 21 July

3957,MifekTheKingOfTheDark,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MifekTheKingOfTheDark/,"Yes and No, Great and Terrible... To be honest it's a great game, but the problem lies in its repetitiveness. Every play is very similar and as the game is built around ""National focuses"" there is not much to be done here. The time period and mechanics make playing nations other than ""mains''(Bigger and stronger countries like Germany, France, Japan) or few interesting ""minors""(like austria, yugoslavia, ect.) totally senseless as you won't ever have power to fight bigger and stronger countries and have a really slow, possibly boring game. It can be great for the first 100-200 hours, after that not much to be done the game becomes boring, once great mods extending content now has a lot of bugs due to changes in code implementation during game development and (understandable)laziness of moders not wanting to change whole mods, because of paradox changing vision. Additionally a lot of new mechanics or DLC's seem forced, too big and steal ideas from mods existing before their release. On top of that the problem of late game lag, when the game slows down dramatically late game. Overall you can just be playing a version of ""Waking of the Tiger"" release and have the same experience if not better, because of less calculations = better performance, less buggy mods and no forced content.

Nearly every country has a unique focus tree, but to get the best out of this game is to buy the content DLC (non-cosmetic ones) for the base/vanilla gameplay with some needed for some mod packs. Also, when playing with mods, some may be outdated for the current version of the game or some mods are discontinued altogether, so be wary of that. It is a hard game to play at first, but after a while of playing, you will either still be a dingus with what you want to do or be a unstoppable force.

Even when choosing to become a new nation through a focus, or making a decision, it is about military. This heavily military-based gameplay implies that being a neutral nation is not a viable option. That being said, the game doesn't pretend it is; but it does render the game's management aspect considerably simpler than other paradox games. It also means that the battle mechanics are much deeper and complex than other paradox games. The game receives a variety of DLCs, addons, and updates; and has an incredible community for both online game and modding.

Although there are a lot of things about the game i like as i am a history buff but also have a thing for alternate, i think there are some improvements and changes a swell as future DLCs i would like to see. The thing i don't like in this game is that peace treaty's are often horrible as they are either not very historically accurate or do things that does not make any sense. I would like it if in single-player the peace treaty should be player led as it can give the player more choice to make an alternate peace treaty to wars or keeping them historically accurate. A thing i would like to see is a DLC to where you can sign ceasefires or armistices to bring a temporally halt to a war in both single-player and multiplayer which would have a set period of time to last when it is up the player or in multiplayer other player could be given the option to continue there wars or sign peace treaty's.

As a fan of most things Paradox releases, HOI4 has to be one of my favorite games of all time. Paradox masterfully takes one of the most brutal conflicts in history, and they created a game that allows you to follow or create history at your very command. You could micromanage to the nearest division and factory, or draw battle lines for the AI generals to follow when in combat. I have had this game since almost the very beginning and it has drastically improved with every DLC / update that has been released. However, that has to be the downside for me, and for most people that ever want to get into a Paradox game. Without the DLC, HOI4 is nearly unplayable, as the DLC adds very important mechanics that make the game 10 times better. They have done a good job of releasing free content updates as these DLC have been released, but the base game feels extremely bland and almost unfinished in hindsight. I recommend getting this game during a sale, so most of the money spent could go towards the purchasing of DLC. Additional note : for those who aren't big fans of this game, due to its simplification from HOI3 to HOI4, I understand the dislike. However, I believe simplification has only helped more people enter the community, as I remember getting into HOI3 and it had the steepest learning curve known to man. This games ease of access and understanding allows for more and more people to immerse themselves into this world of constant conflict. Additional Additional Note : The mod support and workshop for this game is absolutely amazing. There are so many mods and communities of modders that spend their days toiling away to create fresh new experiences and flavors for this game, and to them I say, well done!",Recommended,1485.0,"1,546.0 hrs on record",Posted: 14 July

The tutorial is not that helpful, leaving crucial functions out which would be crucial to learn, and the UI makes it hard to learn functions which could change the outcome of whole game. I'm being serious here. 1. It took me 50 hours to learn, where I constantly googled why certain things happened, what things would do, how to do things. I did this all the while playing the Soviet Union which if I had to tell myself when starting the game, I would tell them to try Germany. 2. On the UI, I saw another player mention the same problem, saying they missed you could attach air planes to armies to help them and he had an astounding 100 or 1000 hours in the game(I memory is fuzzy on what number it exactly was) So what should you play this game for? To relive WW2? Or live a new war, or no war at all. Or just command an army of whatever nation as you combat the, unique challenges each one faces with different tactics to geography and different equipment, and internal problems whether it be ideological or economic. the game is incredible with it's scale and freedom.",Recommended,970.0,230.6 hrs on record,Posted: 11 July

I love it to bits, and I've literally kicked the Germans asses in so many ways that I couldn't count them all on 10 pairs of hands and feet squared. It's the only game where a Communist Luxembourg can conquer the world by 1943, or a Fascist Bhutan can nuke Hiroshima before the Americans. Wanna be Ireland and send paratroopers onto Buckingham Palace? You can do that. Wanna be El Salvador and Send a massive army of unequipped peasants to Washington DC and take over America? You can do that Wanna be Bomber Harris and fly not just, 1000 bomber raids, not just, 2000 bomber raids, but 10,000 bomber raids over Berlin.............................every night?????? You can do that. Its an amazing game, with so many possibilities and one that I have so many memories in, such as hotjoining a game as Bulgaria where my friends who had reformed the central powers, yet declared war in 1938 so we were literally dead by 1940. Or in my first Soviet Game ever (Singleplayer, I had had the game for 4 hours at this points) and doing a mega chad Operation Uranus and surrounding 70 German divisions and then trucking onto Berlin. Yet its soul destroying, you sell your soul to the overlords at paradox. So many DLCS, and none of them updating any of the countries that actually need the updates the most. Paradox: ""Hey communitaaayyy, its time for another DLC. Horrayyy"" HOI4 Players: ""Does this one finally update the Italian focus tree??"" Paradox: ""No, but it does give you some brand spanking new music, and minor updates to Hungary (:"" I've spent more money on HOI4, than all the other games in my steam library combined, and while the devs are great, they do purposely make it impossible for new players to join as once you buy the base game, you have to pay triple the price again just for the DLCS to even catch up to everyone else. Yet its arguably worth it. This game has brought me rage and joy, but given me 'mostly' amazing memories, so I do believe that every penny has been worth it. But maybe, if you do end up buying the game, just wait a month or so to see if you like it before buying allllll the DLCS.... and then maybe wait just a little bit longer for a sale to actually buy them. So my final opinion, buy it. You'll love it and hate it, but its so worth it in the end.",Recommended,1924.0,441.6 hrs on record,Posted: 10 July

4516,xRMGx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xRMGx/,"A review in waiting for a bit of time, but when you start measuring up games to one another, that is when you know you got a real gem (and when you know when it is time to write a review).  And that is what we have here:  I had recently purchased another WWII game, Panzer Corps 2, and I couldn't help but measure it up to HoI4.  (It was lacking, in case you were curious).  Indeed, HoI4 has to be probably one of the best WWII RTS 4X games that I have ever played.  I absolutely love this game.  It ranks up there as one of my most favorite RTS 4X games of all time.  However, this does not mean that the game does not come without its faults, because, believe you me, it does, such as persistent bugs, to name the most prevalent one.  On a scale of 1 to 10, 8-9.5/10, overall. With the TL;DR out of the way, what makes this game so awesome? ‚Ä¢ The sheer complexity of it!  It is by far the most expansive, in-depth WWII strategy games which plays right into the fact that ‚Ä¢ You can really explore the what-ifs of history, creating alternative histories (this is really where HoI4 shines); and ‚Ä¢ Since you can play any country of the world, including Nazi Germany, you can experiment with historical decisions to even change the very course of history, including to where Nazi German wins the war. ‚Ä¢ Modding!  The base game is already pretty good, but the large, active modding community propels the game into an epic quality that makes HoI4 unrivaled, made possible by Paradox's support of it.  The modding community of this game will likely keep it active and relevant years after Paradox, like Bethesda's Skryim. ‚Ä¢ Paradox seems to legitimately care for their game.  The zeal, love, and passion the devs have for HoI4 clearly shows. But, as I mentioned earlier, the game doesn't come without its faults, and there some big ones: ‚Ä¢ The complexity of game does mean there is a significant learning curve.  Unlike the in-game tutorial, YouTube is your friend.  (Although, last I heard, Paradox did state that they are working on the in-game tutorial.  Perhaps sometime in the future this bullet will be removed); ‚Ä¢ Bug, bugs, and more bugs.  Fortunately, nothing game-breaking (at least at the time of this review), but this game has a lot of bugs, including and up to where the AI does things that not only are a-historical, but even things that leave you confounded and frustrated; ‚Ä¢ The devs seem to emphasize PvP, quick to fix bugs there; but with PvE the bugs keep amassing, bugs that had been reported sometimes several expansions previous; ‚Ä¢ The lack of dev support of the Steam community.  If you have an issue or problem or a suggestion, you best post in the official Paradox forums.  Posting it to Steam, it will be ignored (I don't think I've ever seen a dev respond once on Steam); ‚Ä¢ The pay-walling content content that should be in the base game in the name of a DLC is not cool; ‚Ä¢ Similarly, and the last con I would give the game, giving the community texture packs as of a manner to say thank you for years of playing and yet making the community pay for it, it is not really much of a thank you -- it is more of an insult. In conclusion, if you are someone who grew up playing let's say the Total War franchise, then HoI4 would be right your alley.  There is not as much micromanagement as there is with Total War, but HoI4 falls right in line with it in terms of complexity and epicness.  This game, HoI4 is pure awesomeness, well worth a purchase and play.  The base game, on a scale of 1 to 10, I would give an 8/10.

The game in it of itself is worth it for the mods alone as they really keep the game going. I don't like how paradox goes and adds stuff to a paid DLC that should have been in the game. Not really a good review/long  but I say to get the game. DLC is Optional but the two i would suggest getting is Man the guns and waking the tiger. Get the mods TNO/Red flood/OWB/ Road to 56 for a better game experience. all of those have extra content or different timelines to play.

There are other games that have larger time frames but they are even more complicated. Although there are lots of mods with this game that enlarge the time frame.

I picked up HOI4 on the summer sale and let me tell you all. It is one of the most complicated RTS games out there. As a newcomer who only has 15 hours in the game so far, you would have to delve deep inside your soul to find the time to learn the game and not give up on it. Once you understand the general knowledge of the game it can be so STATISFYING. I would recommend though to play a couple of trial runs and tutorials on Youtube because the in-game tutorial on it stinks. It Is a Paradox made game. the same company that gave us Supreme Ruler and Stellaris. Although so far, the drawbacks i see so far is your HUD will be cluttered with information  and especially when you get ready to organize your divisions and armies, there is no easy way to organize your troops in one shortcut key so be prepared. HOI4 is not for the faint of heart and impatient people but if you are a big fan of history and RTS I would strongly recommend HOI4. It has become my second favorite RTS next to Civilization 5.

Once you start actually fighting, the game is nearly unplayable.  Two repeated examples:  1)  The AI shoves 40 divisions into Norway.  It then allows a few German units to recapture the ports and the 40 divisions just die.  2)  In New Guinea, the AI manages to land invasions all around the island no matter how much Navy you stack up to prevent it. I am also stunned that despite all the updates, there seems to be no way to really coordinate with allies.  Australia won't cede even a little island to me, even though they were getting shredded. Considering you have to play through the ""peace"" game for years as the US, the payoff is just awful.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I've watched hours of tutorial video, so there's that.

Even when playing with Historical Focuses, no two games are alike.  The bigger DLC mainly adds additional country focuses which I recommend along with the music packs.  The other cosmetic DLC really isn't essential, and you only notice when zoomed in, which you rarely are when playing.  Paradox continues to update and patch post-launch, which is always nice for complex strategy games like this.

Hearts of Iron IV is a difficult game to get into, Although it can be really fun once you fully understand what you're doing. The base game is really bland on it's own (without any DLC) and The DLC in my opinion are really overpriced (20‚Ç¨ per DLC, when most of the DLCs contain Mechanics that should be in the base game itself.) If you're not into buying DLCs you can always play mods like R56 (Road to 56) and such.

The systems are incredibly deep, that of which in your first couple hundred hours of game-play/watching how-to's will probably only finally get you your first win after many MANY attempts (exclusively playing a major power that can carry your inexperience). That being said, it is a blast to play if you enjoy games of the same type. Don't buy it if you're thinking it'll be just like a video you saw, or it'll only take a couple hours to get down the basics and that'll be enough. In the event you want to seamlessly win, every choice matters, and learning what choices to make takes a long time just to get down for a country that isn't Tanna Tuva. That being said, the options for game-play are endless within a massive modding community and a very extensive base game. But one should also beware the DLC, like an Paradox game, locks behind it an array of very interesting game-play features, so if a good sale hits and you've got the cash, spring for full price and just buy the DLC too if you want to really commit to playing this game. --",Recommended,956.0,140.4 hrs on record,Posted: 30 June

Played around 60 hours MP and I can tell you it's great. If you got a bunch of friends try it. Between the historical and altenative history ways a game can go you will find a wide variety of different mods that can make the game even better. Modding is one of the best things if you're done with the base game. If you're interested in the achievements, I hope you bring some steel nerves with you. It takes a whole lot of time.

First obstacle is the woefully insufficient tutorial, in a game that contains a nearly endless possibilities for setting up battlefronts, fall back lines, coordinating logistics and supplies, having the user mount one offensive in Ethiopia with minimal autonomy or complexity is woefully inadequate. It's like dropping someone in the middle of Rainbow Six Siege, telling them that left stick is to move, right trigger is to shoot, then throwing them into the full game. The second thing you have to contend with is the SINGLE WORST UI I have ever experience in a game of this type. CKIII, the old Total War games, Command & Conquer, I have played most of the ones of the block, if not for life altering amounts hours at least long enough to hang around for the vibe. Good freaking lord it's not even close HOI4 has the worst user interface I have ever experienced in game of this type. Since I am not one to complaint without receipts; ""WASD"" is not used to pan since so many of the keyboard buttons open the in game menus which would be fine except for the facts that ""ASD"" are unused while ""W"" was reserved to open of the top menus in the game (the 1-0 buttons do nothing fyi) and that the user can pan without clicking the wheel on the mouse and several important buttons are on the bottom of the screen. The game has no problem telling you that you are short materials for your war effort, then will proceed to open the production page - not the trade one, where you know, would import materials for tanks and guns - where it is up to the user to go through the produced items line by line to see if you even are short any materials or if you are even producing the godforsaken item that it's telling you don't have enough material for. Maybe there's any easier to check this, but the tutorial sure didn't cover it. The UI is constantly throwing a 'decisions available' button with a bright red exclamation point at you when you accrue the slightest bit of political clout - this is WWII, the most devastating war in the history of mankind - do you have decide whether the motherland will invade Poland to put a few more hundred KM between the German war machine and Moscow? Do you have decide if Japan attacking a U.S. civilian ship is enough to escalate world tensions and go to war in pacific? Must you answer the call of your most hated historical rival and go across the channel to help the French fight back the blitzkrieg? Nah, you simply have enough political power to enact small bluffs on your population that are significantly less useful early game than the ability to appoint major government officials and making sweeping economy and military policy changes which you used the same bank of political power to do. If you enjoy these kind of top down war simulators that are a different take on the RTS genre and enjoy learning about the history of WWII and the era of politics around it, you should pick it up cause the game is genuinely fun, it just between the dreadful tutorial and awful UI, the devs would've had to actively try to make it less inviting to new players.",Recommended,2629.0,22.6 hrs on record,Posted: 14 June

5864,76561198009031187,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198009031187/,"I first discovered HOI years ago with the 3rd installment. Once HOI4 released, it was a done deal. This is grand strategy with a focus on the military side of things. Armies need to be organised from the battalion level. Everything can be rearranged and renamed. Want the US Marines? Done. Besides military, you must worry about production of arms as well as maintaining factories for consumer goods. Way more manageable than it may sound. Politics is also a factor, you may put ministers in your cabinet which favor democracy or fascism or yes even communism. Want to play alt history? Make the US go fascist? Maybe kill hitler and bring back the kaiser as Germany? Have Japan embrace democratic rule, peacefully? Full steam ahead. HOI4 is your sandbox. Spy mechanics are implemented in a non game breaking way, which is to say you can get up to mischief but its not going to bring down the USSR by its lonesome. Naval mechanics are wonderful and diverse. You research technologies for better weapons, planes and ships. Once you unlock a design, you are free to put what armaments you like on the ""Class"" of ship. I personally make carriers with maximum airplane capacity. Since, if you're using the carriers right, you will sink fleets without your fleet ever engaging in battle. The planes will do the job. Finally, I will say terrain and supply chains are crucial to playing HOI4. Dont send your beefed up huge infantry army into south america! Unless you like seeing entire armies ground into the jungle. The terrain wont allow you to resupply or move properly. On top of that, your guys are dropping like flies to the climate etc. HOI4 forces you to create marines or light infantry units to campaign in certain regions. There is an endless amount of entertainment here, well executed and when ya get bored of vanilla? Paradox games have some of the most talented, long running modding communities ive ever seen. ""Old World Blues"" ""Millenium Dawn"" ""Kaiserreich"" to name a few popular total conversions. Cheers!",Recommended,1671.0,"1,217.2 hrs on record",Posted: 13 June

Take time to learn it, give it a chance, and expect to lose a few times before you really understand how to play.

Due to the game complexity, there will be times in the beginning that you may not know what is going on or have difficulties understanding game mechanics. Experimenting, using the tutorial and watching players on Youtube and Twitch helped me learn to play this game, although it did take a couple hundred hours of gametime before I felt like I really understood the game mechanics. The nations you play as in the base game and DLCs also have their fair share of alternate historical paths, such as Communist United States or Fascist United Kingdom, etc. In addition, this game has one of the best mod scenes of any game, with some mods such as Kaiserreich, Equestria at War and Road to '56, among others, providing even more content and playtime to the player.

5945,76561197982725960,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197982725960/,HOI4 is literally my most played game on Steam.  A game that offers an amazing level of depth and truely makes you feel like a general when you start to master all of the different aspects that you need to manage. It immerses you in history and offers great insights in to certain alternate histories as well. It's relatively easy to pick up but there's always something new to learn and you'll certainly learn a lot faster by watching videos or finding someone who can teach you. The developers constantly keep this game up-to-date and making free improvements for all to enjoy as well as releasing new paid DLC. Not to mention the litany of free mods that are available some of which have so much content they may as well be a whole other game. I can honestly say if there was one studio that represented a model for how to engage with their players and continue to support a game it would be the HOI4 team at Paradox.,Recommended,750.0,"2,429.2 hrs on record",Posted: 11 June

Like other paradox games, the base game is pretty much garbage and not worth it unless on a good sale, and the DLC that make the game good are costly. It is $121 currently for all of the DLC. The game, with all the DLC, is not worth $121. Multiplayer is toxic, singleplayer is repetitive. Every game as Germany you do the exact same thing, it isn't fun after a few playthroughs. The one reason I could see someone getting this game (with all of the DLCs) is for the modding, which is excellent, some of the best on Steam. So unless you want to play TNO or Kaiserreich, I would recommend not getting this game. Not much strategy, just spam 20 width divisions or 40 width divisions and try to make as many tanks as you can.

6186,lvxinvicta,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lvxinvicta/,"Well, after five enjoyable years playing this game, I can safely say that it is one of the greatest grand strategy (or map-painting) games I have ever played, and I've played a lot! Although I was skeptical of the automated battle plans as opposed to the much more manual nature of military plans in Hearts of Iron III, I have come to appreciate them for being both easy to learn and more fun (haha arrow go brrrr). In general, I would say that Paradox really succeeded at making a game that was neither too easy and watered down or too obtuse and difficult; I have taught some of my friends how to play the game, and they were all able to pick up the game rather quickly. The modding community for the game is also incredible; I especially recommend Kaiserreich if you want to experience something different - it's very well made and provides a great alternate experience to Vanilla. I admit that I have spent way too much of my time on this game, but the time I've spent on it has always been both relaxing and fun. There's nothing like being rewarded with an hour of HOI4 after finishing all of my work for the day, and the experiences I've had playing this game, both by myself and with others online, have been amazing (except when it comes to the toxicity of some servers). Overall, I'm very happy with the game, and look forward to the 1.11 update along with the No Step Back expansion for further improvements, especially supply (give me my railroads and trains!). P.S. It would be very irresponsible of me to not mention that this game is pretty addicting and can lead to a rapid drop in one's social skills.

6197,pl4t0n1c,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pl4t0n1c/,"The only game that makes me feel like ""Grand"" belongs in Grand Strategy . From 1936 onwards, you have complete strategic freedom, a kind that truly feels global. The game asks you to step into the shoes not just of a nation's leader, but of history, ideology, nationhood itself. For all its faults, for all its nickel-and-diming DLC, for all the little inaccuracies, this is one of the most detailed geopolitical simulations of all time (certainly the most detailed when considering the 20th century), and the only one to attempt both the political economy and combat of WWII. To appreciate it, you have to be the kind of person that can withstand its brutal and intensely steep initial learning curve--but once surmounted, it is unbelievably gratifying to successfully hold the Eastern Front, launch the D-Day invasion, complete the Blitzkrieg, or make an alternate history Operation Sea Lion. Winning the Chinese Civil War successfully captures the grueling year-after-year attrition of that conflict, and coming out on top (as whichever side) feels sufficiently accomplished. One note: this is more of an afterthought, but while the game does skirt around issues of state violence and war crimes by allowing the player to employ repressive police & labor discipline regimes in occupied territories, the broader questions surrounding the crimes committed during WWII are never brought into the foreground. Obviously, Paradox wants this to be a palatable consumer product, and I understand their decision. On the other hand, I think anybody about to spend a serious amount of time essentially roleplaying the most violent conflict in human history should be prepared to wrangle with the ethical implications, and we should at least mention the fact that this game does not ask players to do that. Does that make it a worse or less fun game? Not at all--but maybe there's more to it than that.",Recommended,1584.0,453.0 hrs on record,Posted: 6 June

I've played for 2.5 K hours now and finally unlocked all 132 achievements (don't do this unless you are desperate for something to do) during the quarantine and has been a great source of entertainment. Would highly recommend the base game for anyone slightly interested in History and likes strategy games, but learn the base game before buying any DLC's and then buy them in order. One at a time to learn the game slowly; especially since the game is designed so you get better the more you play it, which I really like. The future of the game looks bright with new DLC's coming in the near future and the player count on the rise. Overall a great game to play and well designed by the developers: so thanks to Dan Lind and the development team, this game has been great fun over quarantine and has made it much easier.

You can either follow the course of history in WWII, or you can choose your own path and even achieve world domination. Some examples of the variety of choices are; making the USA a communist nation, ruling the world as the USSR, firing atomic bombs on London, and much, much more. Games end when you lose your nation or when you choose to leave. Some one could even reach the year 2000 and still be able to continue onward. The game itself atempts to be realistic, with one of the only exceptions being the changing of our current world history. This game does require patience, and games can take up to an average of over 100+ hours, but a convenient save system allows you to play your game according to your schedule. It includes both a single player and a multiplayer mode but I haven't had the chance to try the latter just yet.

6345,teaganlawson,https://steamcommunity.com/id/teaganlawson/,"Where to even start with this game... I have played this game for many, many hours, and yet still not nearly as many as some, and there are still so many things I haven't explored at all. Some of the main things this game has going for it are its depth, its freedom, and the feeling of satisfaction it provides its players. The game places you the player in charge of a country going into World War Two, and from there you can take it in many different direction. You can transform them politically (to an extent). You build their industry and decide what military equipment to produce for your growing military, including Navy and Air Forces. Later on you can decide which countries to attack and who to make friends with, although there are limits to what you can do. For example you can't exactly make great friends with someone whose land you've annexed, or has historical reasons to hate you. The basic vanilla game is pretty good. The pieces are put together in a way that probably won't make much sense to the player the first time they pick it up, yet is still interesting and cool enough to keep them coming back. I remember being overwhelmed the first time I played a game, which wasn't helped by the fact I played as the Soviet Union, one of the largest countries in the game with the largest starting number of divisions. And yet I came back for another few hundred hours of gameplay because it's so fascinating how the game lets you explore so many possible courses of history. However, the base game is rather limited. Many countries do not have their own ""focus trees"" - the branching path of decisions that strengthen your country in various ways and give it a path going forward, but only have generic ones instead. Because of this I only played the base game for a fraction of the total time I've spent playing the game as a whole. Once I discovered the depth and scope of the mods scene for this game I ended up sinking so many nights and days off into this game, fully immersed in the level of commitment and work some people have put into the mods for this game. Kaiserreich, End of a New Beginning, Fuhrerreich, Millennium Dawn, Old World Blues, even Lord of the Rings and Avatar mods are all new things to explore and although each has its own flaws and bugs and problems I find myself coming back to them over and over again as someone who likes grand strategy games. But no game is without its flaws, of course, and focus shouldn't be solely on how much certain people like this game. To be certain, there are going to be people who will see parts of this game and throw up their hands in resignation. For example, the ""division designer"" system still makes almost no sense to me even after hundreds of hours of playing this game. There are about 20 different statistics one must understand when designing a good setup for their military units, and some are much easier to understand than others. In addition the Naval system makes little sense to me and I generally end up losing my whole Navy within a few months of the start of a war. The faction system is deeply irritating to me, as are the literally dozens of popups that will come up onto the screen all at once when something major happens, accompanied by a freeze in gameplay so long it makes you think your whole computer has crashed. Speaking of which, twice now I have experienced a problem after closing my laptop where after reopening it I had to forcibly shut down the computer and restart, one time crashing so badly I had to reinstall windows. I don't entirely blame Hearts of Iron 4 for that, because I don't actually know what caused it, but I think from a technical perspective the game does have some bugs and optimization issues.",Recommended,3048.0,832.3 hrs on record,Posted: 3 June

However, my only criticism of HOI4 is that it isn't as complex as its predecessor, although I look forward to future DLC which promises to add more depth to the game, such as with a more developed supply system and logistical network. Definitely play the game with the BLACK ICE mod installed as it adds much more depth, such as and increases the historical nature of your game.",Recommended,883.0,"1,568.3 hrs on record",Posted: 3 June

I would say the modders are really carrying the entire experience at this point, and it makes me not want to recommend HOI4, but it's just too much fun. For beginners, this is a nightmare(at least it was for me) but once your friend explains the entire thing to you, and you play for a bit, you get the hang of it. That does not excuse the game for being in my opinion, very over-complicated and unnecessarily intricate. I still honestly don't know what half the buttons do, but that's not entirely a bad thing. I appreciate games that go very in- depth on the strategy and freedom, but it is so in- depth, that I can imagine it being difficult for new players to understand. Games can take a very long time, and you can progress very far throughout and gain mass power. By the end of it you are god and the world is one. Its satisfying and very open ended in terms of how you come to your success. Now, I don't have too much experience in the game so I won't pretend like I know everything. From my playthroughs so far, it is good. The game is good. Whether its the community that holds it tight or Paradox making supposedly ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• DLC, I am having fun. I do recommend.

Pros : Good interface A lot of replayability Planning land and air warfare is pretty fun Kaiserreich Cons : Becomes unplayable after a certain point Organizing naval units is too tiring Research has no reason being limited as it is Diplomacy sucks (your allies can and will drag you into random wars that quickly become global conflicts with random countries on every side) Focus trees seem fun but they end up limiting gameplay cause there's no way to change them later on.

Gameplay is a tedious grind having to fight against the very ui and the aspects you command. Arcade simulation.

There's also loads of easy and difficult achievements, which in turn comes with achievement hunters. As I mentioned earlier, you can play with friends, meaning multiplayer, its basically solo just with other players, there are roleplay communities along with communities who use HOI4 as a sport. If you're new to games like HOI4, there are useful tutorials and hints that pop up if you're playing for the first time (or don't have them turned off). So, overall, HOI4 is probably one of the best games in its genre, and in my eyes, the best Paradox game I've ever played (granted I've only played HOI4, Stellaris and CK1).

6658,76561198139866589,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198139866589/,"this is a review of the game WITHOUT any dlc. Combat: - Without DLC, it's really basic and actually kind of boring after a while. + In contrast to other PDX games, there's way less random chance in HOI4's combat. However, it's in dire need of change considering that there is one and only one way to guarantee that your units will win. Build 'space marines' (a division template that basically always wins). + You can design your own ground divisions. + You can design planes and ships - Plane and ship design is really barebones. It's just making a certain stat value higher instead of adding a component to a vehicle. Non-combat: - National Focus: pretty cool feature, however without DLC all the focus trees are really boring and go only one way, the historical way (except for France and Poland). All other nations like Finland, Romania, India, China, ... get a copy-pasted tree. Which is ironically better than the Italian focus tree. - Research: Nice, however after like 10 games (which is a lot of hours) it becomes boring really fast, you'll just be autoclicking - Industry: Very nice, no remarks. DLC-Policy: - Not as bad as PDX's older games (e.g. Crusader Kings 2, EU4) but it's still pretty bad. You'll find a lot of reviews about the game's DLC stating that ""this should be in the base game"", and justifiably so. Modding - The game's modding community is VERY MUCH ALIVE. While this game might be really barebones without the DLC, it's the modding community that drives this game forward by adding new mechanics and focus trees. Most of my gameplay came from playing mods like Kaiserreich: Legacy of the Weltkrieg and Road to 56. Total: 7/10. Verdict: good game, but the DLC policy alone can be enough to some to stay away from this game alltogher",Recommended,1451.0,906.5 hrs on record,Posted: 28 May

However, once you get down the basics (enough to outsmart the AI in some cases), you have a lot of pathways to try out, and complete hilarious scenarios (such as beating the US as Bhutan and having Chad invade Japan). It can get even better with mods, which bring whole new stories to the game, from the alt-history funniness of Kaiserredux to the somber and downright depressing stories of The New Order.

The recommendation for system specs on the store page is the recommended specs for having the game running at 2 hours per second instead of 2 days per second of in-game time at the mid-game, basically making the game so slow that it's essentially unplayable if you don't have the patience of a superhuman.

Despite being one of the biggest IPs of Paradox, this is easily their glitchiest, most-poorly designed, garbage game with probably the worst AI on both sides of warfare. I have played 340 hours and legitimately regret even buying this game at this point. Maybe 40 hours of that time were actually enjoyed while the rest were spent trying to fight through the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to find the tiniest gleam of fun. This game is practically a slap in the face by the developers to anyone foolish enough to play it, and this game has made me so enraged I can honestly say I would do the jail time if I ran into any of the dev team. In fact, those aforementioned 40 hours of fun were ENTIRELY from MODS. This game is sooo bad even with all $100+ DLC, I pray for anyone still having to play the even worse base game. If you want to play a WW2 strategy game, you'd be better off playing RISK, because the mental abuse this game gives you is the equivalent of 6 Serbian homeless men bukkake-ing you, but instead of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• they cover you in liquid ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.

6920,GeneralOrc,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GeneralOrc/,"ORC REVIEW HEARTS OF IRON IV is a tatically realistic grand strategy game. Compared to other games of its type I find it to be easier to understand, as it focuses more on combat rather than nation-building. The game itself is essentially a computerized version of those super complicated irl WW2 games that would take hours to set up and play, but of course all of the calculations are done in the game. The game supports single player and mutiplayer (although mutiplayer is a bit laggy) and games can be expected to take at least the majority of a day, however, it can be saved at any time, even in the mutiplayer. The game has great mod support, and you can find custom maps, skins, and many others that will potentially enhance the experience. The only downside is DLC which locks out some influential features, but the game is still fun without it. I, General Orc, recommend Hearts of Iron IV as a good combat-focused grand strategy in the WW2 era. If you like very long games pertaining to WW2, you will like this game.

As someone who's spent years playing III, with it's little divisional boxes representing a very abstract view of battle, and red and grey arrows depicting the ongoing assaults and retreats of shattered units, I initially looked down on IV's use of 3D avatars of forces as making it look a lot more cartoony. It doesn't, and the fact that I'm happy to play CKII and EUIV with the same kind of 3D avatars makes me realise that was a daft take. Graphically, the map looks so much more alive watching these avatars walking/driving/flying/sailing around it. Another thing that got me was the differences in production between the two. III had resources, and military/industrial/civilian production all bundled into one menu, with the latter three all being abstracted as 'industrial capacity', whereas IV focuses on different kinds of factories. At the same time, it seems easier, but also more complicated now, since I have to set production for different types of equipment (which appeals to the hardcore logistics nerd in me). In III, as long as I had the IC for it, divisional production would just steam ahead, based on which one was first in the list, whereas in IV, if I have two divisions waiting to be trained, only one of which needs artillery, which I haven't produced any at all, then the other division isn't impacted by this, and can just carry on without me needing to do any readjustments. I also like the focuses we're now getting on some of the smaller nations as well, compared to III where if you weren't playing a major power, you would probably end up playing second string to them. On the other hand, I've started a game as Yuogoslavia for the first time, and I'm trying to unite the Balkans against the forces of Germany and the Soviets, precisely because of these interesting focuses. In summary, my mistake was thinking that IV would be III. It's not, it is a very different game, and anyone buying it from having III should be prepared for that. So, to sum up, my review may not be very informative, or very helpful, but I wanted to put my thoughts down. I've just bought most of the DLC's as well, so I'm going to give them a whirl later on today and see how the game plays.",Recommended,2049.0,41.4 hrs on record,Posted: 24 May

It is quite an asymmetrical gameplay experience. While the game does allow flexibility in playstyle, the range of this varies wildly between the playable countries. The soundtrack is quite good, but i wasn't blown away by it. Still a good solid soundtrack that does it's job. The graphics and the character animations are decent. Gameplay has a lot of depth and it in a way feels a bit like a board game. I have to applaud the way the game manages to capture the global nature of the conflict this game covers. I would definitely recommend this game to players fond of war gaming but have to mention that the content pack dlcs seem to be quite essential to the full experience while the cosmetic dlcs seem like they could have been part of the base game.",Recommended,681.0,120.1 hrs on record,Posted: 23 May

Also game likes a snail most of the time so a good pc is required to play past 1942, the game has amazing mods that have more content than the game itself but run even worse than the game alone.

If you're brand new and within your first 200-300 hours (yes, 200-300 hours) you are going to love it, because its depiction of WW2 is spot on (for the most part, this game is not HOI3 and would railroad everything to make everything turn out like how it really did) Although, I will say this: if you play this game long enough, you will eventually come to realize vanilla HOI4 with no mods is extremely unbalanced. Countries that produced all sorts of things in real life will now produce 12ish things and throw 200 of their 300 or so military factories on 2 items, fighter planes and heavy tanks.

7422,Spiky333_,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Spiky333_/,"ts a really good game, like nearly all of the games of paradox. I gave NO for recommendation simple because ALL of their games have a crazy focus on DLC. and DLC's are often even more expensive then the main game. I love DLC's with other games, where you actually get every year for a small amount of money a new experience with the old game. Paradox pricing is ridiculous, it puts you in a hard spot to really really decide if you want to play and love a game, since in the end it will pull money out of your pocket again and again and again (and in a big amount). No, i will not support this. I ask everybody to just expand the ""content for this game"" part and tell me honestly this is perfectly OK .

7473,SIGURAN,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SIGURAN/,"its a good game, especially if you like ww2 history related stuff in order to play the game and truly experience it you need to get the dlcs, however i dont recommend getting them when not on sale because they are too overpriced for the content they offer (mostly). a really good thing that devs included into multiplayer is that if the host hosts a multiplayer game AND owns any dlc at all, you will play that game with all the dlcs that the host has, effectively meaning that if you play multiplayer on games where the host has all the dlcs, you dont miss out on anything the game offers which is GREAT. the game offers a wide range of viable strategies and tactics to defeat your enemies with, which means that the best player, or the best player faction usually wins a multiplayer game (if there are rules and/or mods in place that balance the game of course) when it comes to singleplayer, the AI is pretty dumb sometimes but is really fun especially if you are just starting out with the game. trying out all the most powerful countries and experimenting in singleplayer is awesome and fun. probably the best thing about the game is it's mod support, it is fairly easy to create mods and make something of your own. there are many interesting already established singleplayer and multiplayer mods so when you are done playing the vanilla game you can jump into any of the bigger and popular mods and enjoy the content that the mod offers, which usually expands even further on the vanilla mechanics and in general makes this game a tonne more fun. however, the worst thing about the game is it's optimization. it is almost terrible to the point that sometimes rendering the game in late late game unplayable because of how slow it is, which makes world conquests in this game hard if you are taking your time. most of the time it is not something you gotta worry about if you are looking for a ""average length"" game that will last from '36, the starting year towards '45 for example. thankfully there are mods that optimize the game further and allow for more quality gameplay. if you are going to get this game expect a shallow learning curve for the first 50+ hours, and after that everything that you gotta do is figure out the meta and experiment with all the countries in the game. the gameplay of this game is pretty unique. many countries have their unique so-called ""national focus trees"" which allow you to do some stuff specific to that country alone, developing it in a historical or ahistorical way, or getting some pretty interesting political events and such (unique to the country you are playing). apart from that, during gameplay you improve your industry which eventaully translates into better military, to more wars in your favor, to more territory, to more industry, and so on in a circle. combat in the game is really special as you can customize your combat divisions, choose from different ships or airplanes as you like, adapting to any situation that is to come in wars. all in all i definitely recommend the game especially if you are into ww2 history or grand strategy games",Recommended,2555.0,390.0 hrs on record,Posted: 13 May

7571,76561198127680513,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198127680513/,"Man, this game. It's good, but it's good in a strange, kinda masochistic way. If you buy this it will steal so many hours from your life. You will start with the tutorial, or rather the lack of it. HOI4 is a complex game, with many mechanics that are not fully explained, like Combat Width, Naval Combat, using Paratroopers and Marines, how to set up your units to be optimal, Logistics ecc ecc. Unless you watch some tutorials on Youtube or have some friend to explain it you will not understand some parts of the game, and this is OK. This will take your first 50/100 hours, only learning the game. After this ""Learning Phase"" you will know, let's say, 60/70% of the game mechanics. Now you will play every nation with a worth enough focus tree: you will play historical games and overrun Moscow with some tigers, or mann the Maginot and defend France from the Germans for the second time. After some historical games you will start to play some wacky unhistorical games bringing back the Kaiser or making a communist Union of Britain. At this point your skills will be enough to challenge the AI on par, but after many games you will eventually think ""this is starting to look easy"". After some easy steamroll games you will inevitably want to step up the challenge, and ther're 2 ways: one is mods and the other is archievements. Some players may become bored rather quickly of the historical and unhistorical settings, and some may want a more in-depth look into the game, kinda like HOI3, and the answer is modding. There are A LOT of mods for this game: some are Alternate history (wooo dude, what if Germany won WW1/WW2/noone won...), some are very in-depth in making the game more challenging for the historical settings (BLACK ICE, Toal War), some are set in the cold war or in the modern era and some...some are just memes. With mods this game become eternal. I have almost 1400 hours in this game and I'm sure more than a 1000 are with mods. After you become bored with a mod you can just go on the Workshop and get another, and another, and another, until you see the developers of the first mod has released a new update for his work and the cicle restarts. One big incentive in using mods is that after you try some mods with some new cool mechanics, when you look back at vanilla it just seems lacking in details and boring, so you will only be playing mods forever. If you, for some reasons, dont like mods you can always put the game in Ironman mode and try to get all the archievements, so you can post it on Reddit and get that juicy karma. It can be fun but repeating certain games multiple times to get an archievement is too much for me. One big problem you may see after this phase is DLC-locked content. I'd say all the big DLCs are worth their price (on Steam disconts) but I can understand that spending more than 50$ for some focus tree and a new wacky and unaccurate shipbuilding mechanics may be too much. If you play multiplayer you can circumvent this problem by letting your rich friend host the game, in Paradox games all the host's DLCs are usable for everyone in the game. Speaking of multiplayer, it's a lot of fun when you play with your friends, it's a little less fun if you hop on a random server with strangers: the community tends to be...rather diverse and not really friendly. You can find the unironical fascist on germany or the super min-maxer IPlayOnlyMetaAndWillShoutIfYouDontDoTheSame and the memers who will go deliberately for fascist France in a historical Role-Play server just to piss you off. Overall this game is bonkers, props to Paradox for creating this, but most importantly props to moddders for letting me stay after I became burnt-out from vanilla.",Recommended,3046.0,"1,444.7 hrs on record",Posted: 10 May

It might seem very hard to get in to at the beginning but after about a day of trying out and watching some tutorial videos (the tutorial in the game doesn't help much) I have memorized the mechanics and the game is really fun! You can play as literally any Nation that has existed in 1936 and with mods you can play as even more! (I personally recommend Road to 56 on the steam workshop). For any fan of Alternate History or History in general and Strategy games, this game is an absolute blast! If you decide to buy this game youre in for days and weeks of pure fun! I have a fairly good PC, i got an older 1050ti but the game isn't really heavy on graphics anyway. Nonetheless, i came to notice that in late-game, the frames start to drop a bit, so i needed to reduce the quality, but theres also mods on the workshop that ""simplify"" the Map, so that it doesn't eat all your FPS.

Me and my friends have played it for hours and you can honestly make your own fun out of it. If you aren't one for combat, division design, and keeping with the meta (like me) then you can still easily have fun. There's a massive modding community that can supplement your experience and keep it fresh for however long you need it to, and if you really do want to buy the dlc then buy it. It typically goes on sale quite often and you WILL get at least an hour of fun for every dollar you spend. I personally recommend buying Waking the Tiger for base game as it simply adds so much that I personally believe should be base game, and I would also recommend the mod Road to 56. Watch some YouTube, play with friends, and eventually join random online games.

All in all you can fix some of those issues with mods (most my games are on the Kaiserreich mod for example) , but still everytime I play I always get the impression the game could be better. Maybe they just expect me to buy DLC to find out.",Not Recommended,1051.0,639.8 hrs on record,Posted: 1 May
7914,Phriyion,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Phriyion/,"Hearts of Iron IV started off relatively simple, however, as time passed and patches were dropped, alot of features were added to the game. A warning regarding these, alot of them are behind the DLCs which can be somewhat frustrating, but are in my opinion at least so far, are worth it, although probably go for those that focus nations you're interested in. The game is also great for multiplayer sessions as the timeframe is also  smaller than other PDX games. Unlike other HoI games, HoI4 does not completely stop you from playing minor nations, you can also participate as a minor nation although you probably won't have as much impact as the great powers. There are some fun alternative history routes one can play, but if it's not something you're looking for (although I heavily recommend trying, as forming another faction in the great scheme things just escalates the chaos), you can always just start a game with historical focus on and you get an historical outcome. The game also has alot of interesting mods/total conversions which are great to try out, such as Road to 56, Kaiserreich and Old World Blues.

While others may disagree, this is my favorite game from this developer. As with all Paradox games, there is a bit of a learning curve. Learning curves can be mitigated somewhat by the online community of players and guides. It doesn't tax your system too much and it has some cool features for multiplayer that I really like. For example, you can allow players to hot join. this means you can start a game session on time if someone is running late or allow players to rejoin if they lose connection all without having to restart the game. It feels really polished in that regard. I always end up enjoying myself playing this game and frequently return to it when I go on a WW2 kick. Also, unlike other Paradox games, this game isn't just a demo that requires the DLC to be a full game. You can get the full game play from the base game and the DLC packs really add something different that was not necessary.",Recommended,811.0,336.0 hrs on record,Posted: 24 April

8187,76561198365543460,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198365543460/,"Gameplay: You will feel frustration, anger, confusion when playing this game. It is very difficult to get into, and even more difficult to master. Even with this many hours I'm still learning new strategies and things about the game. There's so much you need to take into account. Equipment, division templates, factories, navy, battle plans, and so much more ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to take into consideration when planning your next moves. But, once you do make that amazing plan that wins you the war, it'll feel amazing. You'll feel like you truly won something, like you actually accomplished something. Overall, the gameplay is difficult to get into, but very rewarding and fun once understood. However, even with the great gameplay loops, the game will start to get boring relatively quickly. That's where mods come in. The modding community is massive for this game. There's practically a mod for everything. You should start out with road to 56 or kaisserreich as those are some of the most fun out of them all and good for entry into the modding scene. It's a lot like skyrim, where it's weird if a person hasn't played with at least one mod on this game once. The mods make the game infinitely more fun, and will make you spend even more time on this game. Graphics: It's an overhead grand strategy game, so I dont think the graphics matter too much. However, I will criticize one thing: The Optimization. The optimization is pretty damn bad. Even with super powerful pcs with i9 processors and the like, the game will start lagging around early 1940s no matter what. It's likely because by that point there is so much going on and so many units and such, that it can lag the game. However, this has been a problem since the beginning, and paradox has done very little to fix it. Music: Music is great. From the epic soviet theme, to the calm and valiant Japan ""Empire of the sun"" theme, it's all here. The soundtrack is very nice and captures this era of history nicely through the music. What's also very interesting is that different areas will have different music entirely, and they won't play music from another area. For example, some music that plays in Europe doesn't play when playing in Asia. Instead, Asia has its own soundtrack which makes it distinct and helps differentiate itself to the European soundtrack. Overall, this game is very fun, and I would highly recommend it. It will be hard at first, but once you learn it, you will end up loving it (hopefully). I'd also highly recommend to look up tutorials and/or gameplay videos so you can learn the basic mechanics and learn some strategies for certain nations. There's tons of guides on the mechanics of the game, and strategies for playing individual nations. It's all there. It may seem daunting, but please, give it a try. You may find this game to be amazing. Oh yeah, and definitely try playing with mods. Mods make the game infinitely more fun, and one of the reasons I'm still playing.",Recommended,2437.0,437.5 hrs on record,Posted: 24 April

But there is still a lot of depths to each mechanics. Sometimes it's a bit much, with all the modifiers, template designer, ships etc... But if you don't to go too deep, no one's forcing you to. I also really like that you can finish a game in a weekend, compared to other paradox games that will take me weeks to finish. The late game gets laggy, which makes the game less enjoyable at that point. Still, 8.5/10",Recommended,713.0,782.7 hrs on record,Posted: 23 April

It is still fun to play despite the glitches and I find myself playing new campaign after campaign. The support for mods is great, and the stream of expansions keep things interesting. It does have a slight learning curve for new players due to the tutorial being basic.  The example game diminishing glitches/poor coding are as follows: 1: Decisions that create puppets glitching and returning the lands to the original enemy owners of the related territories 2: Some major AI issues in abandoning fronts and ports, or transporting divisions through enemy heavily patrolled areas (suicide), or not building and protecting supply lines.

The game itself may look weird or show itself like it has nothing to offer comparing to thousands of other WW2-Themed games on steam. But more you move to the depth of the game and the more you learn, and the more you get addicted to writing the history of the earth through the World War. And I just recently discovered the modding community in this specific game has got plenty to offer the player and the improvements they came with just blew my mind.

However, play before and post war is somewhat lacking. The peace conferences post war could use work, and the lack of a true economy and the use of factories as such leaves a lot to be desired. One could realistically set this game up and build a massive army with little to no consequences so long as a you had the factories to support the size of your military. Personally I would love to see an economy feature introduced in a future DLC so that you cannot just mass produce everything, and so that you are actually required to balance the number of military vs. Civilian factories and it would provide for more complex long term planning to ensure that you didn't run the risk of staying in a protracted war that you could not financially support even if you did have the manpower and equipment to spare.",Recommended,757.0,"1,253.5 hrs on record",Posted: 19 April

8396,76561198820315828,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198820315828/,"I've heard time and time again from friends trying to learn this game saying that it is un-necessarily complex and boring. That theres nothing to do and theres a lack of content. Although the part about lack of content may be somewhat true, as Paradox tends to release a half finished game and then go ahead and make $80 worth of dlc thats adds core feature in the years following release, and I certainly can see that point of view having played for as long as i have. But I would argue that the modding community, along with the sandbox nature of this game are huge redeeming qualities of this game. Dont want to buy dlc? there's likely a mod that does something similar for free (even though some mods need dlc to work but not many). If im being honest, the only dlc that is truly worth buying would be together for victory, as it allows puppet nations to break free, which is really important at least to me. The core mechanics of the game may seem way overly complicated, but its actually relatively simple compared to other games in its genre, and there are a plethora of tutorials on the internet you can find. The game has its own tutorial, but i would not recommend this, as it explains very little. However recently they have added all sorts of videos into the game that instruct you how to do each thing, for example one shows how to assign troops, one shows how to naval invade etc. I would definitely suggest using these as they explain the mechanics quite well. Additionally, the complexity of the game though daunting at first, truly give the game a level of depth once you get the hang of it, as you can mold your country in all sorts of ways, for example you can play as britain and become communist to ally with the soviet union to take on Germany. This brings me to my next point, which is the alternate history element of the game. You can choose whether to have a game go exactly as ww2 did in real life, or you can change history and do scenarios such as if Germany managed to invade the us, or the soviet union took over Europe after Germany was defeated, things like that allow for so many different scenarios and options for you to play around with, giving this game lots of replay ability. Even though the game is build around being a strategic sandbox, it is mostly made towards invading other countries and growing your empire, not necessarily running the country during peacetime. However, there are some really well made mods out there that add many new features to make the game not focused on war all the time, a good example being millennium dawn. Lastly, this game can be a blast when playing with other people especially friends. The sandbox environment allows for so many funny moments such as one time when my friend went through all the effort of invading Yugoslavia at Italy, and at the peace conference he accidentally hit the done button too early, so he gained no land and had to invade again. To wrap it up, Hearts of Iron 4 definitely has its issues being developed by Paradox and all, but these are overshadowed and fixed by the games many fun game play loops of conquering and expanding your nation along with the plethora of mods that are easily available on the steam workshop (one thing to note is that the launcher lets you make ""play sets"" which are essentially mod packs you can put different mods into so you don't have to individually pick them out each time) So yeah, if you like games about leading a country and winning wars through """"""""strategy"""""""" then i would definitely recommend this game.",Recommended,2907.0,"1,125.2 hrs on record",Posted: 18 April

Actual review starts here: Overview: This is a Paradox grand strategy game that focuses around WW2. You can take command of any nation on the world map (major nations are significantly stronger than minor ones) and the Vanilla game consists of two possible start dates, 1936 or 1939. You have control over many aspects of your nation from industry, research, politics, infrastructure and your various different military groups (army, air force, navy). You progress through the game mainly through your National Focus Tree, which is a list of various different decisions you can enact to progress through the game. The most important nations (Germany, Italy, UK, France, US, Japan, USSR and a few others) have unique ones in the base game, and DLC adds many more for minor nations as well as some crazy alt-history scenarios which are tons of fun (Restoring Qing China as Manchukuo or reforming Austria-Hungary are some of my favourites). There is a LOT to learn about this game, so I recommend watching a few how-to guides on YouTube to get started. It is well worth it. Some of the most important aspects of the game I recommend getting used to early are: - How to organise your armies/navies/air wings - How to give orders to your armies/navies/air wings - How to modify division templates - What each division stat does (these have mouse-over descriptions in game also) - How the supply system works - What world tension is and how it affects the game - How different terrain affects combat - How to abuse the living ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of Ground Support planes Pros: - You can play as any nation you like (Liberia world conquest ftw) - Game can be set for the AI to follow historical path or not - Games span many years of in-game time (default is 1936 -> 1948 but can go on indefinitely) - DLC adds many more cool features (espionage, modifying ship designs, differing levels of puppet autonomy, etc.) - One of the most mod-friendly games out there, with some awesome ones to choose from (Kaiserreich, TNO to name a few) - Bonkers alt-history offerings Cons: - Steep learning curve - DLC is quite expensive for what is offered. Try to get them on sale if possible - Italy and USSR have quite out-of-date focus trees. There is a new patch named 'Barbarossa' coming soon though so this may change - You will be branded a virgin for life for playing My personal note: Don't just stick to playing big major nations with their historical focuses. There is so much fun to be had with minor nations and the alt-history trees as mentioned above.",Recommended,2142.0,"1,533.9 hrs on record",Posted: 15 April

Can be very fun for people who enjoy strategy games although can be hard for new players to figure out at first. The abundant use of fairly pricey DLC to add mechanics and focus trees that should be in the base game for free is a bit scummy in my opinion, but I suppose that's just how the video game industry war machine has grown. Mods are truly where this game shines however, I personally recommend Iron Curtain or Kaiserreich: Legacy of the Weltzkrieg, they breathe fresh air into the game and Kaiserreich brings an all new story that isn't actual history. If you buy at least two DLCs (I would recommend Man the Guns and Waking the Tiger) the base game could probably give you 200 hours of fun, I only had to play 50 hours to form an opinion on this game and Its definitely overwhelmingly positive.

I like this game a lot but it has plenty of flaws. It's incredibly expensive to get all the good dlc which make the game work right and naval combat is still a mystery to me so I just throw some destroyers and big ships together and hope. If you can only afford the base game that's perfectly fine. You can still do many interesting things especially if you add one or two mods.  If you like spending a couple hours on building a dnd character sheet then carefully adjust your plans you will love this. You need a great deal of patience and it can be incredibly frustrating but there's a reason I put so many hours into this. Adjusting strategies to fit certain things, conducting diplomacy carefully is incredibly fun for someone like me but it's not for everyone. The thing that makes this different from eu4 or another one of paradox's grand strategy games is war. In this game you control every little thing about your forces and war is everything compared to eu4 where diplomacy is much more important. Personally I've been having a great time with eu4 but that game has an even worse time when it comes to the dlcs. In this game all you really need is man the guns so you don't get confused about naval stuff but everything else adds interesting things. I had tons of fun with waking the tiger and death or dishonor but you don't need to get it. In summary if it seems like your sort of game you can play this thing for hundreds or even thousands of hours but it might have a high price tag. Personally I think that it's better to have paradox do it this way that way I slowly get new content even if it's a little expensive. The game doesn't stop getting major content updates because of these dlcs so it's worth it for some people.",Recommended,1492.0,663.9 hrs on record,Posted: 13 April

HOIV is really it's own thing. Yes it's Paradox, yes it's grand strategy, and yes you can spend hours and hours playing it. This is the only game in the series though that deeply goes into the tactical side of battles. You have a front line, how you form your unit templates matters, too many tanks and it moves slow, to many infantry and it gets bogged down, etc.  There are some other minor mechanics like spy game, but to me it's pretty meager.  This is the best modern WW2 strategy simulator out there in my humble opinion.

I LOVE complex grand strategy games and have hundreds of hours clocked in on many of them, including Paradox titles like stellaris (one of my favorite games of all time!) but this game just makes me so frustrated at its potential for interesting political and state experimentation around ww2 and its failure to deliver on that by creating stifling mechanics that make it a very difficult game to interact with at all.

8827,WildSnowConeMachine,https://steamcommunity.com/id/WildSnowConeMachine/,"You really should never underestimate poor timing of events in this game, and always plan far more carefully than I did trying to rush for the ""En Svensk Tiger"" achievement. There is a death spiral that can happen quickly if you are not careful, and one that not even ""30 Minutes of Hel"" could bring down on me. This is a story then, of sheer bad luck, stupidity, and timing so poor it makes a bad demolitionist seem like they're on the clock in more ways than one. (I will say now that this story is an over-dramatized version of an extremely bad f--k up.) It is the onset of the Winter of 1937. Sweden's Civil War was a Pyrrhic Victory in every sense of the phrase. The Army has been decimated, The Navy completely wiped out, and the already small Air Force completely demolished. There remains a single combat ready division of soldiers ready to defend the realm, and their supplies are minimal. There are few weapons to be fired, and even fewer bullets to fire from the weapons. The few factories producing anything are focusing solely on rebuilding infrastructure, and even then dissident groups and low government support cause further damages. The new regime is collapsing, not even a month after it seized power. There is no hope. There is no salvation. Not for poor little Sweden. That is until the Germans offered their help. They offered food for our people, weapons for our troops, and steel for our factories. They helped, over the course of three months, rebuild the nation. But there were those that were unmistakably angered by the situation in Scandinavia. The United Kingdom and France both demanded of poor little Sweden to cease all trade with Germany. It refused, and found itself at war. Callously, the Germans who had helped the Swedes left as fast as they came. The April 1st Invasion of Sweden was not a joke, and the United Kingdom led invasion had rolled cleanly and effortlessly to Stockholm by April 4th.

Because it isn't, I guess it is just not for me. It comes down to how the game plays out. It is really complex game and i like it's gameplay. just can't and don't want to play it anymore because of the reason i am gonna tell in this review. I have tried all of the superpowers, and noticed that like Soviet union the most and I have learned to play this game ~65 hours of playing. (I know 50-70% of the game). This game does not feel like I have a progression, when world tension is higher than 25% Britain (and his allies with him) guarantee independence to any country that i declare war with. (I am interested in history and know why they do that, but just because it is historical/accurate it doesn't make it fun to play, at least to me) So basically when i capture a whatever country the world tension is above 25% so then if i declare war on any country, Britain and his buddies guarantee. I can't take the small countries and make my country more bigger and wealthier to take down the giants. It's first the biggest guys on the planet and then it is a walk in the park. So basically there is no progression. So it's the same as starting any game from the end of it. Taking the final boss down and then it's basically just clicking ""declare war"" and walking to the country and walking there. I have tried to win or something at least 25-35 times and then the AI (Germany) just finds always a way to capture me. At first i just thought that i need to get good at the game and then it will be fun (still not ""good"" but know how to play). But i would need to beat the games end boss (aka the hardest enemy) and then it is basically what i would like to do. But then there isn't a big enough enemy to be a challenge. Tried to find a solution to my problem, couldn't find any other than drain Britain's political power by declaring war on some country to just cancel it. But it doesn't work that well to be worth the effort. Gonna play it prob again if i fin someday find a solution to it.",Not Recommended,1721.0,68.8 hrs on record,Posted: 5 April

8987,darelldoctor,https://steamcommunity.com/id/darelldoctor/,"Truly an overpriced game, especially with the DLCs. It's basically an Excel Sheet Simulator with a pretty map... with only 1-3 real mapmode. I'd have really liked ethnicity, religion and political affiliation represented by actual pops(like in Vic2) Somehow convincing me that a pie chart is my political landscape, without any information about it... really feels disingenuine for it to be there. Altough, this is a War Simulator, so let me answer you how good it is. The best nation to play in base game(so, without mods) is Japan. Japan is very flexible, can go against the Soviet Union, China or the US. They can use any kind of strategy from Battlefield Support, only Tactical Bombers, 20 widht arti. You can opt for an early war against the US, in which naval warfare is the most important. Any Japan route is satisfying and somewhat hard-ish. Now in contrast to this, playing ahistorical as Germany is just isn't that fun. If you go full naval warfare, you can Sealion Britain in 1 year and from that, the game becomes boring. If you go full medium tank and anti air, you'll capitulate the Soviet Union in 2 years. If you go standard build 40 width arty, you'll lose. My advice to anyone who experiences these feeling should play Kaiserredux. KRX is far more unforgiving to the player, and much more branches in the political climate is open. I do recommend the base game if you're new to HOI4, but after 1000 hours(I played cracked since 2019) it becomes stale.",Recommended,1213.0,247.5 hrs on record,Posted: 4 April

The base game of HOI4 is very fun, with lots of countries to choose from and lots of ways to achieve world dominance. While the base game is fun at first, you‚Äôll soon find out that it gets a bit repetitive and most countries have a basic country focus tree. And that‚Äôs where the DLC‚Äôs come in. There is a lot of them, and they make your game better, if it‚Äôs adding new features or new focus trees. But some people may not have cash for DLC‚Äôs. With unlimited modding potential, you can play mods ranging from The Road to 56 (my personal favourite) to the Fallout-based Old World Blues. This game can be very addictive. 7/10, the base game might get boring and repetitive and modding the game with multiple mods may cause glitches, bugs and crashes.",Recommended,712.0,180.6 hrs on record,Posted: 4 April

However the potential is limited because of the bad optimization. Without helping mods the game will slow down immensely after 1941 which makes it pretty much not enjoyable to me at that point. In addition to that the fighting system is so complex that even after 500+ hours I need to watch youtube tutorials or discord threads to get an idea of what went wrong in my save game because in-game there is no in depth tutorial or explanation on which stats are relevant in which scenario. I am looking forward to HOI 5 with huge expactations since the major flaws are very obvious and should be easy to tackle for the developers.

The only major drawback I can see is the combination of time required and silly inconsistency. For instance I played as the USSR twice in a row, built myself up virtually the same way each time. The first time the Germans put up a really good fight. Moved and attacked in a reasonable way, had a lot of military strength etc. The second play through was a COMPLETELY different story. Germany simply wasn't playing in a competent manner and wasn't anywhere near as strong as it was the game before (and definitely not as strong as it *should* have been). I was able to push them back quite easily because they had very weak military strength and I reached Berlin by late 1942. So I put in a lot of hours only to be disappointed and bored. If it had been a hard struggle and an early end that would have been fine, but the AI was doing so poorly that it just wasn't satisfying at all and felt like a complete waste of time. There's no reason it should be this way. The game has its pros and cons like anything else and you can talk about them all day, but as far as potentially game breaking flaws that is the biggest one I could find (and you've probably heard all the pros 999999 times lol). I don't want the AI to be totally predictable of course, but there should be some consistency and minimum quality to it so that it doesn't act totally crappy and silly like I've seen it do. Technology can definitely allow devs to do this nowadays. Great game though overall, not even close to giving it a thumbs down, just be prepared for some serious let downs and frustration between the awesomeness lol",Recommended,1328.0,322.9 hrs on record,Posted: 2 April

9111,76561198311401258,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198311401258/,"Introduction Hearts of Iron IV is one of my favourite games and I constantly find myself coming back to this game. You are able to choose any country of the world from the late 1930s and play into World War II changing the course of history as you go. You can play as the Third Reich and conquer all of Europe or attempt to defeat them Axis powers. Hearts of Iron IV is one of the rare games where there is almost infinite replayability especially with mods. This game has one of the largest modding communities where you can well in the past or far in the future making the game so much more fun than vanilla. They make the focus trees more in depth and some add onto the base games trees to help those without the DLC which totals to around $200 AUD, one such mod is The Road to 56 which I can definitely recommend. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2467380510 Gameplay Hearts of Iron IV has incredible gameplay, whether it be the immersive sound track, controlling your armies in an invasion or the strategic thinking behind each idea. The sound track to this game is very immersive and the music player allows you to change the song to whatever you want and depending on what country you play different music will play with it. One of the best things about this game is the thinking behind every plan. Without a proper idea as to how you are going to conquer your enemy, you are bound to fail. Setting one offensive order can and sometimes will do the job but it can take much longer than hatching a plan, Its when your in a world war that the grand strategy really starts to kick. Positives The grand strategy aspect of this game is very entertaining and the fact that it is infinitely replayable makes for countless hours. Something else about this game is the modding community, the base game (without dlc) gets somewhat boring after some time so modding really saves the game, there are thousands of mods and a few of them really stand out like the Great War Redux, Kaiserreich and The Road to 56. These mods are some of my favourites that i keep coming back to when i platy this game and honestly i can't remember the last time I played Vanilla. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2530196735 Negatives Although this game is very fun there are still some negatives like the completely ridiculous prices of the DLC and the base game for that matter. The base game and the DLC together cost approximately $200 AUD. This price is seriously absurd for a few focus trees for only a select few countries. Mods do the job just fine and have more effort put into them than some of the DLC. Something else about this game is the really ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• tutorials that the game has to offer. The game offers a series of videos on how to solve each of the problems like unassigned divisions, no resources and no current research, Etc. These were honestly no help at all and I found myself using the wiki and asking one of my friends how some of the things in the game worked and found more success than watching some 20 second video on how to click my mouse on an icon. Conclusion Hearts of iron IV is one of my favourite games and I constantly find myself coming back to it whenever I don't  know what to play. I couldn't recommend this game enough and I absolutely recommend that you buy this game on sale and play mods instead of buying all of the DLC. 9/10.",Recommended,2776.0,168.9 hrs on record,Posted: 1 April

9172,76561198035631000,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035631000/,"Basically unplayable past the first 100 hours without mods, how far the base game has been dumbed down from HOI3 is honestly somewhat of a travesty. TLDR you can tell Paradox is planning on milking HOI4 with DLCs into the future to fix things that should have been implemented day one (you made 3 previous games). Design Companies should be adapted the way Kaiserreich has them working, production screen needs some quality of life improvements, namely re-adding the ability to send something straight to the top of the queue, as opposed to spending 10 years dragging something past 20 stacks of ships. Land warfare needs a serious rework, specifically when it comes to balancing doctrines, because Superior Firepower (SF) is the best by far and there's no reason to choose any other doctrine (even when using tanks). Essentially meaning that any other doctrine other than SF is useless against other players, but is still the best to use against AI as well. Another caveat would be the ability to tell AI puppet or allied nations to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off and stop choking up your supply lines with their ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• troops that dont even conform to a 10/20/40 width template and causing you massive headaches. Land production in the way of ground vehicles needs more design options in addition to the design company making them, as well as additional variants of said vehicles (engineer tanks for example). Naval combat is miles better than it was at release, although the scale of naval production needs to be improved to be more nuanced and at least allow more options to increase dockyard output (carriers take way too long to build even for the US, which IRL laid down and launched tier IV carriers in a year and a half). Air combat needs a serious rework (I smell a DLC), close air support missions should be free flowing and allowed to attack enemy units not in active combat (actually giving a purpose to the camouflage expert perk) albeit at a reduced efficiency or damage to simulate the absence of friendly spotters/air control parties and adjusted to the enemy level of entrenchment. Scout planes need to be more useful than they currently are and provide unit buffs to artillery and CAS missions that they are spotting for. Fighters need to be much more nuanced than ""I have more and higher agility than you"" and actually make the tech and production tree somewhat interesting (plane designer similar to ship designer). Strategic bombers need the ability to target stuff specifically within a region (ports, bunkers, infrastructure, industry) in order to make them more useful than just wrecking everything slower than the enemy can rebuild. Espionage is useless outside of cryptology, what is needed is the ability to queue up multiple agency upgrades so the player isnt constantly having to pause the game to start another upgrade and potentially missing out on a timeline because they are busy elsewhere. I'm sure I've missed stuff, but these are the most glaring issues to me as of the moment. I'm honestly dumbfounded as to how modmakers continue to develop much better and more complex systems in an incredibly limiting game for free at a rate faster than which the devs get paid to do.",Recommended,2645.0,"1,603.9 hrs on record",Posted: 31 March

If you enjoy history from the geopolitical point of view, probably this game is for you. It's not too much in to detail so you won't have to go crazy to win wars, just manage a simplified economy and war supplies. Pros: - replayability, even the same country with the same focus or path can be played in multiple ways of you choosing which type of warfare to adopt, + if you change focuses you can really play one nation and have much different scenarios - multiplayer, this games thrives on multiplayer: it's kind of fun alone, more to enjoy, but really gets you to think and be ready for everything if played with you friends, be sure to garrison your ports! - community, the community is really the backbone of the game, with incredible mods coming out weekly and people  updating your favourite ones constantly, if you wanted something to change in history, someone has imagined that (or you could do the scenario yourself! The game is ez to mod, I even tried myself) Cons: - paradox's DLC policy: the game is not complete, the dlcs cost lots, and yatta yatta yatta. Just see the playthrough of one of them on YT or see the devs play it and find out if you will like it or not. {A big game changer is that if one of your friends or you have it, even one in 10 people, if he hosts the multiplayer game, everyone will be able to play with the dlc} To sums it up: the game is a little hard to learn at first, everyone that started on his own lost to Ethiopia on the first try [never played the tutorial], but once you learned the basics it's just practice. If you like map games or just the ""frontline wars"" like ww1 and ww2 you will come to like this one. 7.5/10 without the community 9/10 with the community",Recommended,1432.0,"1,542.4 hrs on record",Posted: 30 March

Want to show the world that France could have single-handedly taken out the Nazi war machine? All this and so very much more awaits you in this game.  The DLCs do nothing but add more facets to the game, from dealing with your nation's fuel supplies to being able to make your ships exactly as you want them to cloak and dagger stuff, the devs for this game seem bent on making it the best war sim ever. I don't think they've missed.  You don't even need anything close to the best of computers to run it.  I will say, though, having played both the windows and linux versions on what can only be called a 'good value' sort of computer, the linux version does run much better.

9362,Vancethan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Vancethan/,"It's really fun, only downside I can think of is the reliance on DLC that Paradox constantly markets. Challenging and fun to play, also turning off historical focuses is so fun cause it's tosses the game up. For example, I revived the British Monarchy (which caused me to lose my Dominions with Canada, Australia, NZ, and South Africa), joined the axis, and further colonized Africa. I then formed 20+ collaboration governments with numerous countries (my holdings in the Americas, like Jamaica and the Bahamas, my many holdings in the Middle East and Africa, and Asian holdings). And then helped the Germans and Italians win in France which Germany actually lost all of its land until the Land division conference happened with France, and we're currently struggling against a very powerful Soviet Union due to the Reich falling and being revived in a weak state. The game can be played in a historically correct capacity, where unless you're playing a key allied power poorly or in a historically incorrect manner, Axis will almost always lose. DLC is sadly worth it, Paradox releases a mostly finished game then finishes it with DLC which is kinda cringe, but the DLC is great. But the game is still playable and fun without it, so don't feel like you have to. 7.5/10 game base, 9.5/10 with DLC and I still don't have the newest expansion Bosporus or whatever.",Recommended,1131.0,133.5 hrs on record,Posted: 26 March
9363,Canuckjinn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Canuckjinn/,"This game has seemingly endless re-play ability. There's a plethora of scenarios and ways to play just about any nation. It's also really fun to gather up friends and play online Moreover the modding community is fantastic and honestly makes this game that much better with a multitude of different eras, scenarios, alternative timelines etc. (for example the iconic Kaiserreich mod all the way to Cold War or even some with modern day scenarios) Honestly i'm 500+ hrs in and i feel like i'm still learning some new things about the games mechanics to this day. I will say that the learning curve is far from friendly to new players and the ""tutorial"" is an effing joke. The whole process is really just trial and error. ( Or in my case screwing up divisions and accidentally losing a million men in the Netherlands :| ) Beyond that i'd actually recommend against getting this game if you don't plan on getting most of the major DLC as some pivotal mechanics are tucked behind that paywall. Regardless, the bottom line is that this game is definitely amongst some of the greatest grand strategy games ever released. Flaws and all i'd say it still easily stands as my favourite strategy game and i'll keep on playing it. If i had to rate it i'd say it's a 9/10, The cons: DLC is needed for the true experience game gets dramatically slower after about 6-8 years of in game time regardless of how good your pc is tutorial isn't friendly to new players late game nations spam out a horrific amount of divisions, wars can become a slog some DLC is overpriced and i'd say wait to get it on sale pros: incredible value, re-play ability tons of variety continued support from devs and modders alike solid online play (even with mods) A delight for anyone who's a fan of alt history (or history in general) There's really too many good things i have to say about this game that i've sunk decent hours into (and will continue to sink in many more), so before buying please also consult opposing reviews to construe an opinion in case i missed out on any cons. Lastly i'd like to say:  i have yet to see even a hint of this game feeling stale. In my opinion, this is a must buy for any strategy gamer.",Recommended,1792.0,578.6 hrs on record,Posted: 26 March

Half the fun I think is steep learning curve.  Plus, it's so detailed and there's so many factors that go into your decisions and so many ways to ""win"".  Speaking of, you never really win.  At some point, the fighting just kind of stops and you can continue with new goals, or just quit and be satisfied because you had fun. It can or can't be historically accurate (as far as who attacks who), depending on how you set it up in the beginning. It features lots of real-life leaders, military figures, events, etc. so you learn a lot about history while you're at it. So in summary, don't give up right away because it's an extremely steep learning curve and if you accept the fact that making mistakes, losing over and over, and figuring out the game itself is part of the challenge, you'll have a good time.",Recommended,730.0,93.0 hrs on record,Posted: 21 March

I must say, much like heroin, I am addicted to this game. I cannot even begin to describe the rush of dopamine I feel when German Panzers cruise down the Champs-√âlys√©es or as American paratroopers rush through Moscow. Let me tell you a story. In 2017, I used to think toilet humor was funny. Now, in 2021, I find myself sitting below a bookshelf full of books by Rommel, Guderian, Sun Tzu, and countless other generals as an Austro-Hungarian flag and the Union Jack flutter behind me on my closet doors. It has been 4 years later and a total of 50 days (24 hrs each) in game since HOI4 first graced my Steam Library. Am I a better man for it? Hard to say. Am I a better tactician and military strategist? No doubt in my mind. Prepare yourself, future Field Marshal, for this game will change you.

Because I played it quite a bit, and enjoyed it very much, I feel like I want to leave a relatively detailed review: General Important Information The game has a very steep learning curve. For new users, especially new to this genre, I highly recommend watching video tutorials online. It's the most detailed and complex WW2 strategy game I have every played. There are lots of things to do in different aspects, such as diplomacy, politics, economy, army composition, strategy, air, amazing options for navy and of course tactically managing battle plans. There are some great mods out there. Start with vanilla and then try a few mods, such as road to 56 and more. The Good Lots of options, and lots of choices. This leads to great replayability to the game. I return to the game every few months for a session of fun and joy. Navy (with MTG) is super fun. Designing ships and setting plans is complex but very rewarding. A history lesson disguised in a game. Graphics are really good. Honestly, I feel like they aged very well considering this game is 5 years old. Future sequels (HOI5 if there will be) should mainly improve other stuff. Very high level of detaisl, ranging from historic weapons, to provinces, to rivers, etc... A history lesson disguised in a game. Mod support is great. There are great mods out there. I really recommend ""Road to 56"". The Bad (and what they should improve in HOI5) Game tends to run very slow towards the end, when armies are beginning to be very big. Really, I'm talking about a a very FPS. They should improve performance. Battle plan control sometimes don't work as expected. Especially on fragmented islands, but not all. There are a few bugs here and there, even after 5 years with a game still selling plenty. Mainly UI bugs but also game bugs. Most of them are not game breaking though. Garrison game is weak. I believe ""La Resistance"" improved that, but it should be more interesting in vanilla. Paradox's DLC curse didn't miss this game. There are many and they cost some money. I do feel though that it's not that bad, but for now, for example, I'm not buying ""La Resistance"". Late game sometime gets tedious when you know you are going to win. This is the same in other grand strategy games (or 4X like in CIV). They should improve that with extended research IMO. Conclusion I really recommend this game. It's amazing. ""The Bad"" doesn't really affects ""The Good"". The people which will enjoy it the best are grand strategy lovers and WW2 lovers. It's not an easy ""first strategy game"" though.",Recommended,2160.0,123.2 hrs on record,Posted: 13 March

If those things get boring there are always mods raging from modern-day tech trees and focus trees to total ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• of mod where you can create your Furry fascist empire. But it's not a perfect game it tailors for the specific niche of gaymers that are ready to may more for this kind of game. And the biggest fault with this game is the learning curve it takes hours of gameplay or youtube tutorials to learn the fundamentals of the game.",Recommended,777.0,217.0 hrs on record,Posted: 9 March

GRAPHICS i would give a 5/10 as graphics don't matter that much as it is a map game but on the highest settings the game can look ok. PC requirements: the game can run on the lowest settings a toaster, keep in mind thought some mods requirements are much higher. online: the game can be very fun with a friend, but other then that you will most likely not play online that much in it. SKILL LEVEL TO PLAY: the game is very easy to learn and take very basic skill to play. keep in mind that if you are good at the game you will find things it it more fun and engaging for ex: micro managing units, meta strategies can make you demolish the ai.

10562,76561198039310545,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039310545/,"Although there are not many strategy games about war of this time period, it is the best war ""simulator"" I've ever played. While most games focus solely on resources, unit production and fighting, this game is so complex (as managing a war would be in real life in that time) that before you grasp the basics your head will be spinning from all the things. Many complex mechanics are interwoven together with politics which, admittedly very difficult to get into at the beginning, can be very rewarding once you understand it. The game itself does not do a good job of explaining you at least the basics (or at least back in the time when I started playing it did not), so be prepared to read guides and seek additional information because while there are many ways how you can play the game to have fun, there are only a few to be victorious (if world domination is your objective, that is). In my opinion, a BIG plus of the game is its soudtrack. Frankly, there are not many games which would have such a captivating soundtrack that, just by listening to it, would make me want to play the game instantly. When I first listened to the soundtrack, I remember thinking ""hey, what a strange choice of music for a game of this genre"" but quickly I came to love it. Sabaton all the way! Like it or not, the game does teach you something about history (and quite a lot if you let it) which is another thing that I love about it. It does not really matter if you did not know about all the major events of World War II prior to playing the game, in the first couple of games you may be lost as to what will be happening but eventually you will get used (to some extent) to the unpredictability of the game. This is, in my opinion, another big plus of the game. In a real war, you never know how the situation will unfold itself and despite your best intentions and meticulous planning, all can go very quickly to hell if, say, some country starts justifying against you when you have already a war with someone else going or even because of other ""details"" such as when you forget to deselect your troops from training before declaring war or when you overlook an enemy naval invasion in the heat of battle (well, it can be tedious sometimes to look over your shoulder, especially if you fight on multiple fronts spanning the entire planet). And when you can play the game enough to win as any of the major nations, then... it is time to uncheck the ""historical focus"" mode and try some real madness :)",Recommended,2034.0,222.1 hrs on record,Posted: 6 March

But keep in mind these games aren't for everybody,  If you're like me and are missing more than your fair share of brain-cells, learning these games can be a chore but if you are into the idea of an alternate history sandbox strategy game thats just about infinitely repayable even without the mods and DLC, which almost always receive more criticism than they deserve, This is usually because there is always a percentage of the player-base who are butt hurt that their save or current strategy were up ended by the implementation of new mechanics or ... there are the rest who are crying about the paradox grand strategy game business model. Typically this complaint is that all the dlc they release should be included in the base game and it's some sort of flagrant cash grab that completely fails to comprehend the idea of value>cost. For a game where the average player who actually take the time to learn to play has usually something between a few hundred to a few thousand or more hours in the game, shelling out $10-$20 every other year or so to support the further development of an obviously worthwhile endeavor is a better deal then spending $60 on a game that will likely give you even a fraction of the time or lacks the depth and complexity that bring all the nerds to the yard and will be discarded into the depths of the ass end of their steam library in short time.",Recommended,1158.0,268.8 hrs on record,Posted: 5 March

Paradox is not shy about charging us $15-$20 every year, for some rehashed asset flip dlc, when they should be making a new game (Victoria 3 anyone?) Of course, when it comes to customer service, and tech support, Paradox might as well be invisible, unable to come up with a solution to get their own game to work.

This from a company known for making great grand strategy games. I really can't say much more than that, but if you liked any Hearts of Iron game before this one, you'll probably enjoy this.  Its the same basic gameplay, while playing somewhat differently than HOI 3.  One major difference is the battle plans system, where the ai will carry out your planned invasions somewhat effectively, though not perfectly. Also another major change, is that factories go up in efficiency the longer you leave them producing a single item without changing. Example: If you are producing a 1936 light tank, if you leave that factory producing a light tank uninterrupted, production will get faster and faster over time, to a maximum cap, which can be increased with research.",Recommended,714.0,352.8 hrs on record,Posted: 22 February

The built in tutorial covers barely anything, no political, naval, air etc. There isn't even an official explanation of the mechanics, their solution is to just link to a Wiki from within the game. I kept getting into positions where I'd feel like I'd be best of starting again because I'd wasted all resources building tanks or spending political power on pointless actions. The final straw for me though was the fact that the vanilla game UI tells you to send air supply missions to your troops when they're cut off (personally I think the AI that manages your armies for you should do more to stop itself being cut off but honestly I can live with that). Obviously, air supply missions are not explained anywhere in game, but searching reddit threads says you need transport planes. So I build some, and try and run an air supply mission. And you can't because apparently it's only a feature in the DLC, yet is displayed as an option in the vanilla game (presumably this was a feature they gutted out of the base game to sell DLC). Ultimately my frustration with the game outweighed the enjoyment I was getting out of it. I imagine it's more fun once you learn all the ins and outs but the fact that the game expects you to learn all that through trial and error (and that each trial takes 10s of hours) and intentionally misleads you about what you can do in the game means I can't recommend it.",Not Recommended,1296.0,100.6 hrs on record,Posted: 21 February

11166,lmaoooooooobruh,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lmaoooooooobruh/,"A fantastic game that has a lot of depth, especially in military gameplay. It's relatively approachable for a Paradox game, which makes it a good choice regardless of your experience with grand strategy (it was my first game in the genre and I understood like 80% of the mechanics by 20 hours). Multiplayer, if you can get a good group, is great. Out of the Paradox games, this one is the least DLC-dependent because of how many amazing mods there are that cover most of the content. The main issue with the game is that it can get boring sooner than some other games, since you're basically repeating a 12 year period over and over and many of the developments happen pretty consistently, but this a. only occurred after like 250 hours for me, and b. is largely solved by mods, multi-player, and using smaller countries.",Recommended,676.0,375.6 hrs on record,Posted: 19 February
