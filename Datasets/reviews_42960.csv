9,76561198082903799,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082903799/,"The UI is confusing. The economy breaks late into the game. The learning curve is exceptionally steep. The tutorial: practically nonexistent. It's still the best grand strategy Paradox has ever made. This is the only game, in my opinion, which actually feels like you are running a *real* country, not just a paper representation. Every solider, artisan, peasant, capitalist, craftsmen, all the parts of a population (POPs) are modelled with needs and wants, which must are fulfilled by the world economy. Dozens of goods flow in and out of the world market, the price of said goods being affected by supply and demand. Elections are modelled based on the actual political leanings of the POPs, immigration, internal migrations, birth rate, death rate are represented. Your nation is not merely a entity on the map, it is the product of it's diverse peoples- just like in real life. It's incredible to see your nation turn from a rural backwater to a strong industrialized state- or just as interesting to see in crumble as you deal with a collapsing economy, an angry populace and an ineffective government. Let's all hope that Victoria 3 takes these principles to heart, and delivers a worthy successor to this masterpiece of a game.",Recommended,1029.0,414.0 hrs on record,Posted: 22 May

Secondly I love this game because it focus on what I find interesting - governing a country. PS:  Transvaal was actually named the ZAR = Zuid Afrikaansche Republiek meaning the South African Republic. It later became the Transvaal Province in South Africa. Criticism: The game doesn't make provision for the Anglo-Boer War, one of the most important events in South African history and the very event that ended the existence of the Boer Republics (ZAR & Oranje) to merge with the British colonies of the Cape of Good Hope and Natal to form > South Africa. By the way, Oranje is actually the OVS (Oranje Vrij Staat), that later became the Vrystaat (Free State) province of South Africa. Where do these names come from?

Its strongest feature is its economic system, which is quite in-depth and dynamic (note that I play with the Pop Demand Mod, which greatly improves the economy, among many other things). The simulation of political reform and development is also very interesting, the tech and invention system is Civ-like, while the diplomacy model is alright. The military aspect could use some attention in any possible sequel, as it's a bit generic and bland. Overall, this is a very good game with a community which remains active and a lot of mods available at the Paradox forums.

Its war mechanics are easy and simpler than EU4, not even mentioning HOI4. And I think among those 3 games that I mentioned, the one with the most indirect game progression is Victoria.

I was backstabbed and I betrayed too, I juggled with crises, manipulated proxy wars, extended my sphere of influence and made grand alliances to do 4 great wars with, everytime with different allies and foes.

Furthermore, Vic2 also has a very unique industrial system, which when combined with trade mechanics make it a very efficient economy simulation game. However, the game in my opinion is only enjoyable once you get the 2 major DLC: Hearts of Darkness and A House Divided, as without those the game is really buggy and extremely basic. This might make problems for people who do not want to spend this much money on games, however Vic2 and DLC are often on sale on other sites other than steam, so it shouldn't be hard to find a copy of the base game plus DLC for 10-20$ (USD). Therefore, if you liked games like Europa Universalis and Stellaris, Victoria II is another great experience, and significantly cheaper than EU4, which has a lot more DLC.",Recommended,739.0,271.3 hrs on record,Posted: 8 May

153,Mii_ller,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mii_ller/,"Great game! Spent a few full months of my life playing this game. I finally learned with Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen is! Reminds me of this quote. In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since. “Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.” He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought — frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth. And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction — Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”– it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No — Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.",Recommended,2443.0,"1,171.3 hrs on record",Posted: 27 March

156,lolconman,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lolconman/,"I've played A LOT of Victoria 2 over the years, and I keep coming back to it because it offers a very unique experience in the world of grand strategy games. While the combat systems leave something to be desired, as most of the important war decisions are made before it starts, the golden goose of this game is its economy and pops system. Every single good that is produced in the game is tracked from its seller to its buyer, and every single person on the planet has things they want to buy and money to spend on it. This is a game where I am able to start literal world wars over petty border disputes, and I am often more interested in watching my factories buzz along because its just that interesting to nudge them in the right direction. And I do mean every pop, this is not some Stellaris style game where millions of people are represented as a single unit. While the game does group demographics together, they are split into incredibly distinct categories and have an exact number of people in them. The nationality, religion, profession and location of your pops all end up contributing to how it interacts with your wider nation, and it feels incredibly complex without becoming completely obscure. the 10,000 Catholic-Irish craftsmen who have immigrated to Boston may not cause much of a stink for Uncle Sam, but the several million Koreans in occupied Japanese territory certainly will make the Emperor have a bad migraine if he's not careful. No other game I have ever played can simulate an actual economic crash or a politically motivated rebellion (or some combination of the two as is often the case) in an emergent way like Victoria 2 does. The major downside is that as an older Paradox title, it can have trouble running on newer devices, and mod support is non existent, and if you enjoy it enough to play it like I do, you are going to want to mod it. However, there are plenty of good instructional videos on how to go about this, and anyone who is familiar with doing more manual modding processes probably wont have to much issue with the steam version. Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Paradox style grand strategies, but is looking for something a little different than their usual fare.",Recommended,1843.0,384.8 hrs on record,Posted: 20 March

Lastly you can play as some South American or Middle Eastern country and bide your time, slowly becoming a superpower.

The simulation of political and social reform and development is also very interesting feature, the tech and invention system is pretty Civ-like, while the diplomacy model is alright.

Here are some of the bugs which you may face: - There is no UI scaling so you can forget high DPI monitors (4K, 1440P), unless you like squinting - If you have two monitors you may have to turn one off otherwise a black bar will appear on the side of your screen, this might be another 4k issue. - Random crashes can happen so you may want to save frequently I may also need to mention that this game really needs the DLCs, there is allot of content lost without the DLCs which you can of course expect from Paradox. Please do also note this isn't EU4, the DLC situation isn't as bad. If your fine with playing a game were you have to read a tutorial on how to open it and what not to do I would suggest giving it a go.

This game is very, very bad at introducing itself to new player, I'll tell you that much lol. However, once I caved and bought the game on sale a third time, I committed to it and now it's easily my favorite Paradox game. If you're looking for a robust socioeconomic simulation from Paradox that offers actually interesting simulation beyond just a surface level, this is the game you want. The population is dynamic and ever evolving, with population expanding in real time down to the individual citizen. These citizens have different roles which can change depending on the conditions they're in. These citizens consume resources, different depending on who they are, that also are individually tied to a global economic simulation. While this game can be buggy, it offers a level of complexity in its simulation beyond any of the other paradox games. Because of the detailed population mechanics, the game feels a lot more alive to me than other Paradox games (CK is also good in this regard, but in a different way). The economy is also alive in a sense and can function on its own with only moderate input. The short timeframe is also to this game's benefit I feel, as it avoids the absolute slog that CK and EU4 can end up feeling like after centuries. A full 100 year game is still very long, though, make no mistake. Things move fast in the Victorian era. Overall just a really great grand strategy game, certainly one of the best in the genre (if not the best, but that's heavily debatable of course). Make sure you get the dlc, they're essential. Also check out the mods, some of them are really great and add some really good refinements to the base experience.",Recommended,1485.0,183.6 hrs on record,Posted: 10 May

Paradox Interactive is the publisher of most games like this you see floating around the steam store. Their most notable titles are Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis, Victoria, and Hearts of Iron. theyre generally high quality games with good production value. but thats where their good things end. every game is treated as a ""launchpad"" for several ""major"" dlcs, all of which's contents should absolutely have been included in the original release of the game. Often times, these expansions dont even change much, and they ask for a baseline of FIFTEEN DOLLARS for each one. it costs nearly THREE HUNDRED USD to buy all of the dlc for crusader kings II, even though that game is free. This isn't the thing that really got me riled up, though. It's the fact that paradox acquired one of my favorite games of all time, Prison Architect, and within a few months they churned out a garbage DLC like they usually do. I really like the games that paradox puts out but i seriously cannot and will not continue to support their business model. ♥♥♥♥ you, Paradox.

402,76561198073360091,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073360091/,"So, in terms of a video game, I'd say 4 out of 5 stars. In terms of a paradox grand strategy game, I'd say 2 out of 5 stars. This is a 4x grand strategy game set in the victorian era that takes place from 1835 to 1935. While it's historically accurate, it does leave out most of the african tribes in west africa, and it oversimplifies diplomacy. If you've never played a paradox game before, I'd recommend it since it's a fine game, but I personally would recommend playing a different paradox strategy game, since they've got much better games. Personally I would recommend Europa universalis IV, and imperator rome instead of this game. It is a nice change of pace from those two, but It's not as well refined. The good. This game has the best economy I have ever seen in any game. 5 out of 5 stars. I like the technology system. 4 out of 5 stars The diplomacy is simple and easy to use. 3 out of 5 stars since this is also a frustration to me. The production of units is based on actual economic cost. No matter how much money you have if you don't have any rifles you can't recruit new infantry battallions 5 out 5 on unit recruitment. The way your government interacts with the economy is dynamic depending on what type of government you have 5 out of 5. As france, I used laisez faire economics, so my economy managed itself. The Bad. Using the influence mechanics countries arbitrarily control other countries just because they are one of the top 8 countries in the world. The ninth country has influence over other countries in this fashion until he becomes the 8th, then suddenly he has the same as the number 1 country. While the system is cool, it's jarring, and I think it done the wrong way. Countries have no opinion change based on what is actually happening, their opinion of you is solely based on if you are one of the top 8 countries, and then if you are controlling them, or being discredited by the other powers. Because of this AI's almost never form truces with each other unless they are the top 8, and the minor nations are meaningless except as nuisances and pawns. 2 out of 5 The population growth is lacking. Yes people die in wars, but the population growth rates in game are based off the population growth rates of developed countries in the 21st century. Growth rates that are just barely above the replacement rate. Back in the 19th century, as many as 50% of people wouldn't live to see adulthood in some places, but the average family would have 6-8 kids(including stillborns and miscarraiges in both numbers), so you still get the population increasing by 50% every 40-50 years. The main reasons the population didn't stick to what it'd been was medicin and industry advancements, but like France went from maybe 10-20 million to almost 60 million in 100 years, and germany went from about that many to 100 million in germany.(not austria)(note that as many as 70% of the estimated 9-15 million germans in northern germany died in the 30 years war). So, while this mechanic has the potential for 5 out of 5 stars, due to the growth rate before researching any tech being about a 0.0 % growth rate, and the growth rates after researching medicinal techs being as low as 0.02, and 0.04, this mechanic actually becomes a bit of a hindrance when considering how their economy works, so I give it 2 out of 5 stars, but admit with a little polishing it can achieve more. Great Britain is as powerful as he historically was and unrivaled in power and a bully. 3 out of 5. The revolt mechanics only allow you to deal with a revolt after they rebel, and they will keep arbitrarily gathering armies after they reach 100% rebellion chance for up to 5 years, and you're powerless to do anything to stop it once revolt chance hits 100% even as the number of soldiers they're going to field goes up from 150,000 to 6,000,000 of my 14 million citizens. It's frustrating cause in other paradox strategy games I can try to prevent rebellions, and even if I don't their strength doesn't just keep arbitrarily going up untill every citizen in my country is now a soldier in the rebellion. Instead when the rebellion chance reaches 100% they rise up, and I can send my armies in. I honestly think this mechanic is the one that breaks the game, and it just makes me mad, cause if they fixed this, I'd honestly change my recommendation, and recommend you get the game. 1 out of 5 stars. So war exhaustion is a thing, and it makes sense, an army is coming and burning cities, parents get tired of sending their sons to die in wars, that makes sense, but that's not the main driving force in war exhuastion in this game, if it was I'd say 5 out of 5 stars. But no, the main way of getting war exhuastion is peace offers. You see, you might get 1 or 2 war exhuastion a month if enemy armies occupy 5 of your 150 provinces, which makes sense, but as soon as they get 3-4% advantage in the war, they have enough war score to ask for a small demand, and so they do, about twice a month. This normally wouldn't be a problem, but if the enemy is winning the war, even if just by 3-4 percent, and they offer a peace treaty, and you reject, then the player gets 5 war exhuastion, and 1 global militancy, and this can happen every 20-25 days. (keep in mind militancy is what makes your pops rebel, so having 3-4 militancy in a province will spark a rebellion.) So in my campaign, I was at war with england, the most powerful country in the world, and I was winning, I had just invaded london (succesfully) when what do you know prussia declares war on me (france) and invades my territories. I immediately sign a peace treaty, but before I can bring my troops home, they've occupied 4-5 provinces, in the next 8 months, I get 8 war exhuastion from having provinces occupied, bring my war exhuastion from 36 to 44, and I get 40 war exhuastion from 8 offers of surrender, at this point, I've started occupying prussian land, I've destroyed all of the ottomans troops(they were a cobeligerent), but despite having overwhealming force, and a string of victories in every battle, my people are defeated and rebelling, simply because I didn't immediately agree to surrender. If this mechanic hadn't existed, I could've easily annexed all of the ottomans land in africa, and taken some land from prussia too, but because I lost a couple territories in the 2 months it took me to get my 100k troops home from england, and reinforce the damaged regiments, I had to reject 8 offers of surrender in that time, and now I've got a revolt of 14 million frenchmen out of population of 8 million that happens 2 months after the war. of these people unhappy with the government, they raise an army of 6 million soldiers. Yea, 6 million frenchmen overthrow the government, just because they didn't agree to surrender french land to prussia. Kinda not a thing that would happen ever. Imagine that imperial france defending against prussia and the ottomans in a war, and they win overwhelmingly, but 6 million frenchmen rise up as soldiers against the government just because they didn't accept surrender for 8 months during the 8 month war. There was a 0% percent chance that would've happened in the 19th century. Sorry paradox, bad play on that mechanic there..  so this mechanic is a 0 out of 5 stars, and it's the other reason I can't stand this game right now. TLDR 2 out of 5 stars. Reasons to play. Amazing economy. Your government plays differently depending on what it is, and that effects how you use the economy too! The tech system is decent. Reasons not to get it. The revolt system suchs. IF you reject an AI peace offer, your citizens will revolt as in you'll get an army to fight that has 50% of your population in it, and all of your native origin armies will defect to the revolution, just because you rejected an AI peace offer. So, I don't recommend because the flaws kind of ruin the good parts, and cause your save to just become not playable anymore. 2 out of 5 stars.",Not Recommended,6520.0,51.1 hrs on record,Posted: 11 May

It is a complex geopolitical simulator which, if you enjoy map and spreadsheet games like I do, you will enjoy for hours. The UI is fairly intuitive but the underlying mechanics are complex and will need some experience to understand, even after 1k+ hours I would not claim to know them. What I love most about this game is that it has no defined goal, you can play as any nation and create your own goals and build you own nation. It is a 'game you do not have to play' which means that the basics just run themselves, your decisions are what matter and they have massive impact on the game but it is not apparent. On your first play though, I would advise choosing an irrelevant nation and just learning the mechanics. Conquer the world type strategies are not applicable in this game. Learning and understanding the mechanics are far more important as you go. The worst part of the game is the 'complete cluster f*** of war'. It is exciting, but it will cost you thousands if not millions of your people, You will be so diverted by combat that you will forget many of your best plans, and even perhaps your greatest and most experienced armies. I find this realistic based on reading enough history to understand that sometimes a message does not get there and an army does not move. I explain my stupidity with a realistic message does not get through scenario, because I find the cluster f*** fairly true. This game puts you in the position of government and does not hold your hand. You can, quite easily, lose a war to internal rebellion when on the cusp of victory. If you want an experience that will make you pace about wondering whether a war is worth the losses, this is the one, if you want a role play experience in the 1836-1936 era, this is the one. If you want an easy to understand, low barrier to entry type game, with little effort, this is not the one for you. This game is great for those that like proper strategy, map and spreadsheet style, with complex and deep economics and Naval/Military strategy. I ruined one of my wars because I failed to secure enough supply and the market crashed so non of my army had ammunition or weapons. This game is my favourite, without a doubt. I can chill as NZ, AUS or IRE, or wage war as France or Russia. Some of my best runs of this game have been as Ethiopia or Persia. You find your place and your fun if you like this type of game.

Victoria 2 is a wonderful game by itself, but it is so much better with Mods. The modding community grew quite a bit over the last two years, and there are many mods that could be games on their own - and there's no hurting in starting the game with mods, especially if you play those who just add to the basegame; HPM, GFM or TGC are those that instantly come to mind for me. Everyone who owns this game should definitely try those! That said: the game is a lot better with the Expansion Packs, even though yellow Prussia became a well-loved meme over the years the base game has many flaws that only really get weeded out by the Expansion Packs.",Recommended,621.0,"1,359.5 hrs on record",Posted: 27 June

643,76561199096037173,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199096037173/,"I originally bought this game on a whim - because it was on sale and I was buying Crusader Kings 3. As of writing, the time I've spent on Vicky 2 is 139x the time I've spent on CK3. It's quite addictive. I don't think it's too intensive. My computer is about as old as the game and can run it fairly well unless there are millions of troops on the screen. I highly recommend playing it with both DLCs AND the Historical Project Mod (HPM). HPM essentially just makes the whole game better: adds more African and South American nations, adds more events for a wide array of nations and improves colonisation. My only gripe is that it makes some events take longer to achieve. For example, if you want to form Germany or Italy, you need the 'Nationalism and Imperialism' technology, while in vanilla you needed to meet the requirements and could form either in the late 1930's. I like much about the game, so here are the immediate cons for the unmodded game with DLC. (HPM fixes some of these) -Most uncivilised nations are boring. -Not much to do in South America unless you're Brazil and even then, not much. -Economy makes no sense. -Awful tutorial. -Late game can get boring/frustrating since you're either too strong for anyone to pose a threat or you're too weak to become a Great Power. There's a reason people play Germany, Italy or Japan. They have a lot to keep you busy and it's very easy to become overpowered as any of them (well, mostly Germany and Japan) so you can bully other nations. I definitely would recommend!

717,76561198236305322,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198236305322/,"Vic2 is a great and incredibly complex game and I don't think its gotten half the attention it deserves. I understand that for many its mechanics and more complex features are difficult to comprehend, however this should not take away from how amazing it is. Unlike other paradox games *cough* HOI and EU4 *cough* one cannot easily paint the map and become an uber power (unless of course you're playing as Prussia/Germany, which if you play correctly can bone everyone else in the game). The game has mechanics in place which prevent you or the ai from gobbling up all of Europe instead a proper balance of power and international system which you have to operate within. This of course is reflective of the period wherein the concert of Europe and Bismarcks system both served as means of preserving the BOP for most of the 19th century. The infamy mechanic plays an important part in this. The infamy limit is 25 if you go above it the other great powers will gain a cut down to size casus belli against you. However generally speaking this doesn't happen so long as you stay below 25. Of course there are cheats which go around this and furthermore if you build up your military to a ridiculous size it doesn't matter what your infamy is as no one will fight you. However In order to ""win"" this game one must focus on things other than military. This can be difficult as the economic system in the game is incredibly complex and a successful economy means more than keeping the green line green. Furthermore the Pop system is also incredibly complex; each pop represents a single male worker and his three member family. It can be difficult to manage such a system and for new players it is best to not worry too much about any of it, The game is also arguably more long term as opposed to other paradox games in that in order to do well at the end one must lay a solid foundation at the beginning. It is more important to research certain specific techs, encourage literacy, build up industry and establish a network of alliances than to wage war. There are different options available for a player who wishes to achieve their goals other than war itself. War is a useful means of achieving ones goals only when victory is certain, when not one should avoid it. In this sense vic2 is similar to EU4 or crusader kings in that there are many options available for the player. For example if as France you wish to prevent the formation of Germany (an absolute must btw if u do play as France) without firing a shot one can do so by allying with Austria and Denmark and building up a sphere of influence within the German states. If Prussia is able to form the NGF and beat the Danes and Austrians they will come for Alsace-Lorraine after which they will become Germany and well nigh impossible to defeat as France. However by taking the aforementioned actions you can prevent this and preserve the balance of power.  Of course war is also useful in that seizing the Rhineland from Prussia or joining the Austrians in the brothers war can greatly aid you in your goals, but it is not 100% necessary. The point here is that you have many options available before even firing a shot. This adds another lay of complexity to the game. Another great feature is that generally the game remains mostly historically accurate in that nations which in this period did not become major powers won't. In other words you won't find Switzerland taking over all of central Europe, Brunswick unifying Germany or Belgium conquering France. This is because of the infamy system but also due to the diplomatic system, even if they wanted to do such things  none of the nations mentioned could because of the balance of power and the different alliances and great power spheres of influence. Also in vic2 one cannot really wage wars of conquest due to the warscore and infamy limits. The maximum warscore is 100 and each war goal is worth a certain number. This means that all of your war goals, which include your original casus belli, can only add up to a maximum  of 100. If they go above 100 the ai will not accept them. This means that as Belgium for example if you somehow managed to defeat and occupy all of France you cannot conquer it as to take each province costs a certain warscore and to take all of them would add up to well over 100. Therefore at best you could only take maybe two or three French provinces. Furthermore prior to great wars/world wars the infamy cost of taking another civilized nations provinces is 11. This means that if starting the war with 0 infamy you could really only take two French provinces  before going over 25, without cheating. This all means that one cannot blob and paint the map as in other paradox games. This also means that generally in Europe and the Americas one will not find too much border gore. Africa is of course a different matter. The colonial mechanics in the game are interesting. Unlike in EU4 one does not need to send a colonist to areas they wish to colonize, instead there are certain techs that need to be researched and ones ports must be near enough. The only major area which can be colonized is Africa. It is also impossible to colonize Africa before 1870. To colonize one simply needs to select a province and click colonize. Of course this is where one of the failings of vanilla vic2 comes to light; in Africa excluding the far North and South there are only two independent nations; Ethiopia and the Sokoto Caliphate. This of course ignores the many tribal kingdoms which dotted the continent but also makes colonization a fairly easy process. It also often leads to border gore and a terrible mess across the African continent. There are several mods; notably HFM and HPM ( which are musts once one gets the base game and two major dlcs) which 'fix' Africa in that they add in many new nations across the continent and limit any large scale colonization of the continent until after an event modeled on the Berlin conference occurs, usually around 1880. This gives the great powers a ""scramble for Africa"" casus belli which enables them to gobble up the various independent uncivilized nations across Africa. Base game vic2 excluding dlc and mods is only ok however true vanilla vic2 is with both dlc; a house divided and a heart of darkness. Base game vic2 is a burger without the patty. You are not getting the full game without both of those dlc. This is unlike with EU4 or HOI4 where there are loads of dlc and you only really need some of them to fully enjoy the game. With vic2 you absolutely need need both, no question. Both dlc greatly enhance the game and one should not consider buying vic2 without also getting both dlc as you will not enjoy and experience the game to its fullest without them. Of course a problem for many with this is that the base game costs $20 and so do both dlc. This means that to actually play vic2 one would need to spend $60, not 20. Now vic2 is a great game, I wouldn't have played anywhere as much of it as I have if I didn't think so, however it is not worth $60. With this in mind only get the game plus both dlc when it is on sale. Once you've played the game for a few dozen or hundred hours I'd say consider getting the sprite and unit packs as they both add a bit more flavor to the game and it is always satisfying to see your German units marching with full Prussian and imperial German uniforms rather than the standard vanilla ones. There is so much more I could say about this game but I think I've written enough as is. TL;DR: Amazing game, incredibly complex and enjoyable. **Only get with both dlc and when on sale**; the game is amazing, but it isn't worth $60. Also it is nice to ruthlessly exploit workers for all their worth whilst also throwing millions to their deaths in a great war over whether the Netherlands or Spain should control Samoa while Mozart, Wagner and Beethoven play in the background.",Recommended,6483.0,"1,355.6 hrs on record",Posted: 11 June

929,76561198071275511,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071275511/,"I guess I have enough hours to leave a pretty thought out review now. All my time is on vanilla, mostly with DLCs, which some people will tell you means I should reevaluate my mental health, but you can probably take to mean the game is even more enjoyable with mods. I'll probably compare vicky to stellaris a lot, as they both fill the niche of easy paradox games in my opinion, and I'm fairly sure I've gotten about the same playtime on both. I will start this off by being realistic - honestly, Vicky 2 probably isn't the best Paradox game in the world. That said, it takes 10 hours to really figure out, and maybe another 10 to REALLY figure out, meaning you can spend 930 hours actually playing. Contrast that with other paradox titles that are constantly updated and having added depth to keep older players interested despite making things ever more complex for newer players. I have something like 500 hours in EUIV and 270 in CK2, but didn't have the time to learn them when they came out, and struggle to catch up now, so most of that play time is really just screwing around and figuring out how to do things again before they all change. Most of Victoria *isnt* actually complicated, just opaque, but it's not hard to quickly realize you don't really need to understand how a lot of the actual mechanics operate, as long as you know how to work with them. That's really 90% of what the appeal is. It feels and plays like a Paradox game, more so than another simple game like Stellaris, but you can pick up the basics really easily, and do well enough to take on the AI in most situations. Then it's a matter of if you want to play it more like an idle game, challenge yourself, or try something really new. It does this better than something like stellaris by dint of the entire game loop having a very different start. Vicky is pretty varied, much more like what you'll experience in other paradox titles, while stellaris is pretty consistently going to play like a straightforward 4x game. Obviously, you get far more for customization options than you do in Vicky (you can cheat those in to a degree), but the basic gameplay for at least the early portion won't vary. Which brings us to the biggest downfall. The end game isn't always great, especially due to the various, but generally unchanging starting situations. If you play as France, you're gonna be the number one world power by the midgame, and will be able to crush everyone if you play actively and conventionally. The late game just makes that easier for you, while more modern games (stellaris) are built to throw new challenges towards you. You can invert this by playing weaker nations that really develop in the later game, but it does mean that, for most of them, your early game is either sitting around waiting for things to build up, or having to obsessively micromanage. If you find you often restart games to try new things or whatever, this is 100% one for you. If you like the Victorian era and want something not too crazy to get into, also for you. If you want something really expansive and have the time and energy to really sit down and learn a complex grand strategy game, something like EUIV probably does have a lot more to offer as a whole, though you will also pay a lot more for it.",Recommended,2686.0,"1,028.1 hrs on record",Posted: 8 May

They would sell it at a normal car price and you would have to slowly pay for every other car part in order to end up with a functioning car after half a decade or so. This being their business model, it led me to wait several years before purchasing their product. I am still in love with the original Victoria and it´s expansion Revolutions, but I also wanted a bit of a change. So I gave Victoria 2 a try. I love everything they´ve done, and how they´ve incorporated a lot of mods into a new whole. The map is better, the game behaves great, the engine is forgiving to modding errors and it doesn´t feel alien at all. What I don´t like is the missing population micromanagment options.

This is a game that I absolutely love, and I've pumped hundreds of hours into. More than my steam numbers would show. I would go so far as to say it might be my all time favorite paradox game. There are so many things that are great about it. The detailed political system with parties, issues, reforms and election campaigns where your choices may or may not change outcomes. It has a challenging but rewarding diplomacy system based on spheres of influence which can be threatened at any point by existing rivals or emerging powers within the sphere. The military system, and the fact that soldiers are recruited from segments of the population, which don't necessarily regenerate at a set pace makes combat encounters uniquely intense and stressful for a grand strategy game; and after a few deadly battles you'll find yourself meticulously planning your fights for minimum casualties. The culture system in the game is also unique in that multiple cultures typically coexist inside a single province. The game more or less accurately models the diverse and amorphous patchwork of languages and nationalities found in different regions of the world. What's more is that unlike in more recent paradox titles like Imperator and CKIII, the rate of cultural change is quite realistically slow. Don't expect to fully assimilate the population of your nation over the short, 100 year timescale. To me, this really helps the 19th Century setting to feel more immersive. That's not even touching on the colonization and economy systems, which could take up pages on their own, and are both quite deep and rewarding systems that might be the game's best selling point. As for more general stuff; the game runs alright, not great. It's very cpu intensive in the late game, and even on decent modern rigs it can chug. For a 10 year old game, that's not a good sign. If you have a lower end pc, your performance will be worse, but in my experience it's still playable, even on most laptops today. The UI and keybinds are surprisingly pretty good given how old it is. Rally points and shift clicking are very needed features that this game has. If you play a lot of CKIII, you might get frustrated at how few keyboard shortcuts there are; but once you get into the flow of things, it's really not that bad. So everything I've had to say so far has been either positive or neutral. Victoria II still holds up, and if you could get it at a decent price, I highly recommend it to all grand strategy fans. The problem I have with this game is the cost. Getting this game which came out in 2010 and its DLC today will cost you $66. That's ridiculous. Just getting the two expansions and skipping the (Admittedly needless) cosmetic upgrades will still set you back $50. For comparison, Crusader kings III which came out last year and its single released content pack will cost you $59. So buying Victoria II today might very well cost more than Paradox' most recent game. Is it worth it though? Maybe. I mean I've put many hundreds of hours into it. But $60 for a game going on 11 years old is a huge turnoff for most people, and understandably so. That's a big investment for something that is not nearly as polished as other games in the same price-range. If it goes on sale, which it periodically does, I can fully recommend it; and if you find it somewhere else cheaper, I would also fully recommend it; but if the pricetag of $66 is too steep, that's understandable.",Recommended,3042.0,689.5 hrs on record,Posted: 16 April

I'll outline my first 3 experiences in the game below: In my first game as the US, I got invaded by the British twice, lost most of New England to them, and then had to deal with over 20 years of constant civil war/revolution after the official ""Civil War"" due to the instability of losing two massive fully mobilized wars. Eventually, I ended up as a socialist US, and finally won back the territory stolen from me 60 years before. In my second game, I played as Russia. I achieved a 90% literacy rate by the middle of the 19th century, invaded Manchuria, lost 30% literacy, and had to go to war with a British/Chinese alliance. Also formed the USSR about 30 years earlier than historically reasonable and burned down Eastern Germany around 3 times. In my third game, I played as Brazil. For a while, I roamed free in South America, accidentally invaded a nation in the US Sphere of Influence, and then waged a successful 4 year guerrilla war in the Amazon against the US and their allies, eventually succeeding in getting Panama or whatever Central American country I attempted to get a chunk of land from. This is the most interesting historical grand strategy I've ever played. Simply by playing things out (and not reverting to an old save because one bad thing happens), so much fun stuff can happen. I have a hard time getting into any of Paradox's other grand strategy games because none of them are quite like this. I desperately pine for a new political economy simulator",Recommended,1261.0,192.8 hrs on record,Posted: 10 March

Whilst the game will basically require you to get the DLC if you really want to get the full experience, I like to see it as just part of the price of the game. This game deserves more love and a sequel, considering the game is now over a decade old with the most recent DLC (Heart of darkness) being release in 2013. I'd also recommend looking at the mods that are out there as things such as the HPM and HFM mods can really improve the experience. Personally, I found it was  somewhat difficult to learn but that's not considering I have had no major experience with this sort of game before. The game will provide a scope of over a century, from 1836 to 1936 allowing one to play through a post Napoleon Europe, the formation of Italy and Germany, the colonisation of Asia and Africa and the first world war. If your tempted by the game, get it (with a heart of darkness and a house divided) and you'll be sure to fall for it. :) Plus, we might end up with a sequel if enough interest is shown.
