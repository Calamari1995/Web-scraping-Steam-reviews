I've created utopia personified, grand architectures of the combined might of thousands. I've wiped out the galaxy, ended untold trillions of lives. I've burned, cracked, erased, pacified and converted entire worlds. I've uncovered ancient mysteries and dead civilisations. I've fostered friendships and alliances, federations that dominated the galaxy through cooperation. I've been destroyed by the hubris of resisting a steel tide, been devoured by eldritch swarms and absorbed by ancient extradimensionals. I've seen stars collapse under the weight of a shared ambition and ideal, and watched as the heavens are torn asunder by the gods themselves. I've put my iron boot to the neck of all xenos scum, and made them sing praises to a corpse throne. I've sung the tones of the damned, and collected all lifeforms to ascend into my image, and my image alone. I've done unspeakable things in the name of profit. I've reshaped the galaxy through unseen and deft diplomatic hands, enstated myself emperor and made all bow to my will. I've reshaped nations, empires and fought blood drenched civil war against myself. I have been a learned scholar. I have been a fervent zealot of the shroud. I have been a champion of the people, and of freedom. I have been the god emperor, the one above all, the autocrat and philosopher king. I have been the oppressor and the puritan, the blood court and the exterminator. I have been the diplomat, and the seeker of the spurned, the creator of alliances. I have been the crusader, the unending tide of war and the admiral of an eternal fleet. I have been the timorous oak, the defender and developer of utopia. I have been the confluence of thousands of minds and voices, a devourer of worlds, a parasite or a simple mind. I have been the metal horde, speaking in a chorus of binary tones and logic- an exterminator of flesh, a curator of the lesser, and a twisted all encompassing matrix.

4,SpaceCouncil,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaceCouncil/,"The Expanse. Me, Grand Strategy and 4X aren't on the best of terms. The reason being that I feel there's always this latent pressure to learn when and how to build... faster. Optimizing research paths, knowing when excess upkeep is necessary, etc — that every measure taken must be calculated for something that won't happen for literal hours of gameplay to come to fruition. Ensuring that every action performed is in 'the' appropriate way such to devastate and overcome any other players. They always feel multiplayer first. It's a hurdle I've not yet been able to overcome as I don't particularly enjoy that pressure. I'm not going to really bother explaining what Grand Strategy or 4X games entail specifically. As in all honestly, I find them to be a rather niche genre already. And one I feel as though I'm breaching into to boot. The term 'alien' feels appropriate for more than a few reasons. And that's largely why I've stayed away from this game. Stellaris , for me, is set apart from your traditional Paradox endeavor. Your historical Crusader Kings, Victoria, Europa Universalis or Hearts of Iron. I like to view Stellaris through the lens of a story generator of a civilization with a malleable government with varying ideologies and values as they explore and expand into the universe. All the while building a robot army or gene splicing a species' behavior, among other things... Sometimes I just like to look into space. Another thing is that the game's mechanics favor expedience, for example: Events such as finding an abandoned drone facility has an air of mystery at first. What happened? What sorts of alien tech or creatures were here and why? But if you've played a number of matches, you'd know this is semi-scripted event — or rather, has a set path and quest-line. Once found, you'd know that after it's researched it'll result in the binary effects of increased mining station productivity or increased damage against drones. This is expected, but I feel it takes away from a lot of the wonder . The 'victory' conditions are relatively complicated but ultimately end like many games in the genre do. There's a defined stardate and whomever has the highest score at that time is declared victorious. That score is then calculated by a number of factors like economic strength, technology level, number of systems and colonies within the empire — the list [stellaris.paradoxwikis.com] goes on. That said, while the game can be difficult to learn, it remains extremely customizable. And you're able to play any match beyond the specified stardate. Often uncompleted research projects will be effectively locked beyond your borders. And should you desire to complete a quest-chain, you'll need to either broker a deal with neighboring empires to enter their borders or.. become more aggressive. Space is really big. These games take a looong time to complete. It's kind of a galaxy sandbox in many ways. Every game takes place within in a single galaxy. By the end of my first game, I had already put 27 hours into it. But that was with me stopping every 2 seconds to read everything. Once you've got the basics, early game stuff is relatively straightforward. Function over form. Basics insofar as sending science ships out to survey, building starbases around stars with natural satellites and resources, then building a mining station to start increasing stockpiles to expand. Choosing to not build starbases around less resource intensive systems in the early game when they cost more, in both resources and influence, slowing down overall expansion — keeping in mind your 'Empire Sprawl',  or penalties to research and the increased cost of things based on how stretched out your resources are. This can be mitigated by increasing administrative capacity. Now, that may sound involved, but those are the basic buildings blocks. After learning that, the rest falls into place. Finding stargates/wormholes or using experimental subspace navigation for faster travel, being diplomatic  with other species, getting into skirmishes with hostile alien factions. You name it. Do mind LV-426, though. You're able to assign admirals to fleets, scientists for research, governors for sectors of your empire. You're even able to design your own ships, by default it's set to 'auto-best' — whatever the newest tech you've researched will be used. Even if it costs more, so bear that in mind. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2409044107 It should be noted that in order to receive achievements , you need to engage Ironman mode. But it does feature a plethora of mods using Steam Workshop integration . Two things I learned early were to start using the return to nearest starbase function — any ships not currently doing anything should stay there to lower their overall upkeep cost. Another is that you can expand districts to create more housing instead of building more buildings. This typically will add both housing as well as jobs and generate more energy credits or minerals, etc. You can also make decisions such as distributing luxury goods, subsequently increasing amenities and happiness while inadvertently decreasing crime. It's not the most concise UI, it can be rather wordy and number-heavy. It takes some getting used to. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2409010777 The wording can be odd as well, “Starbase Capacity” isn't actually affected until you've upgraded a starbase to a starport. As starbases are what actually increase your borders. Playing pacifist comes with a few caveats, for instance early on when I was warned by a neighboring empire to not place starbases near their borders and decided to go against that warning, they felt it prudent to 'humiliate' me and destroy my very small military. Diplomacy is paramount. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2404746667 The Paradox of Expansion: Paradox has set a precedent of releasing DLC that has gone unparalleled stay for EA's The Sims. Every game they make has tons of expansions. Which is great! But it's also something I can't really endorse fully. Even games they publish are subject to this expanded siphoning in games like Battletech and Cities: Skylines. This practice has also extended into IP's acquired after the fact — Prison Architect — where they've effectively repurposed ideas within popular mods into “expansions”. They've even gone as far as making Crusader Kings 2 F2P with a subscription model available. I don't own any DLC at the time of writing this. Though, it's likely I'll acquire some in the future. It's a practice I find distasteful, but I also want more content. The hallmark of ambivalence. However... The ambiance of space. The sound design is incredible and the OST is even better. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that it's one of the best I've ever heard. Right up there with FTL and Mass Effect. I found myself getting emotional from the music alone. The Gist: Stellaris is certainly my favorite theme for a Grand Strategy game. Admittedly, I'm a veritable n00b in the genre. Grand Strategy and 4X I've always found as a simple idea but in practice to be extremely overwhelming. Largely due to feeling like I wasn't performing the 'meta' correctly. Wherever that feeling may have falsely come from. It's something that's always present. That said, I highly recommend the game as it checks a lot of boxes, it's got a lot of depth and replayability, it's about space/sci-fi and it runs essentially on a potato. It's the one Grand Strategy/4X I adore despite its failings. If you've read this far, consider following my curation  — Station Argus",Recommended,6392.0,331.8 hrs on record,Posted: 26 February

I would have recommend it 2 years as well. But today? Today is a ""no"". I feel bad for new players. Yes, I have 2000 hours in this game, and those 2000 hours were awesome. I had a ton of fun with it, but Stellaris is now in its death-throes. If you want to buy the game as it is today, buy the DLCs until Megacorp, set your game back to a non-current version, and play an older version of this game forever with no updates and challenging mod support, maybe it'll be worth your time. Buying the game now - spending $200 on all the DLC to get caught up - and then having to deal with the constant mismanagement, poor quality releases, and - frankly - pure utter laziness that has been done with the recent jump to 3.0, please don't. You're doing yourself a disservice. The below is addressed to current fans and whoever the current Game Directory/Project Lead, which I can only hope manages to pull their head out of their own ass, stop huffing their own farts, and admit they ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up. Stop doubling-down on these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ decisions and just admit you made a mistake. Why is it so hard for you to admit you made a mistake? Everyone makes mistakes. ============= ""We do recognize that putting limitations on the previously endless growth can feel bad, and that the large number of sudden changes can be shocking. Internally, we’ve been playing with the system for months, and know that while it will take a transition period to get used to some of the changes, we believe that these changes are better for improving the long-term playing experience."" Unless you play like, half the damn empire types that are available, right? Because a few of them are distinctly broken. My guess is there are... 10? 10ish devs that playtest the game, and they each have their pre-made civ they use, maybe they have a few to rotate between, and if they work okay, they all sign off on it. Clearly none of them are criminal heritage megacorps, we all know that one right off the bat. Nor are they fanatic purifiers, non-gestalt lithoids, or machine empires. Rogue servitors? Better for the long-term experience? Is that a joke? ""As such, we're planning on reducing the number of pops necessary to upgrade capital buildings to the higher tiers."" You're just doubling-down on this. Man, I've been playing this game since launch. I've endured a lot of changes, and it feels like up until Megacorp the changes were all taking the game in an overall positive direction. Since then (Megacorp was by far the worst DLC on release) it feels like the game is slowly in decline. It is getting more and more half-features slapped on top of the existing systems with little-to-no integration in existing mechanics (espionage), inconsistent game design (lithoid traits tied to portraits, but necroids not?), and increasing instability which can apparently only be solved by literally cutting everything in half, which is also inconsistent - you just added a DLC a couple years ago which added a planet type whose entire purpose is to be massively overfilled with pops! I regretting pre-ordering Megacorp, but it was slowly brought up to something usable, so it ended up being okay. I bought Federations after it was released and they fixed up the stability and bugs, but generally find the Galactic Community to be more numerical microbonus busywork. I bought Lithoids (should have done something unique and cool like this with Plantoids!), but passed on Necroids (how are they not just non-gestalt devourers?) and based on all the reviews, took a hard pass on Nemesis. Over the many years watching this game progress, I can pretty much see a big, fat line painted in the development timeline when someone decided they were just going to milk the game for money instead of trying to fix its underlying problems. Features are now just piled on top of each other, and it's starting to look more like a digital Jenga tower than a competent software application. When we experience volume-related slowdowns in our product at my software development company, I'd be ridiculed for suggesting we just halve the volume. Does that mean we terminate half our customers? Do we put a cap on client workflows so they can only do so much at once? No, that's not sustainable and it's a lazy solution. If you want to scale - in volume or complexity - you need to put the work in. It doesn't give a dollar value - you can't sell stability to your customers, they expect stability.

If you wanted to buy the entirety of the game as it exists today, it would cost over $200.  As good as the game might be, that is obviously a ridiculous price to pay for a game and its DLCs. Let's say that you've only bought the base game for $40, it should still be a satisfying experience in itself, right?  In reality, what awaits you is a significantly neutered version of a potentially great game and your experience will be akin to playing an extended demo.  This wouldn't feel unfair if everything in the original game as released was wholly intact in the base version and not locked behind DLC purchases.  It seems the developer got greedy for DLC profit and decided to neuter their own base game, essentially turning it into a demo.  If you decide to further purchase an expansion for $20, you get a small section of features and content, and can look forward to continue to pay much much more for the whole of the game.  It becomes hard to enjoy what you paid for once you realize that you are actually just playing a small part of a very very expensive game.  Imagine having to pay $10 or $20 extra every time you want to play a new race or try a new ship type or try a new strategy, all the way until you've paid $200+ dollars.  It becomes just a bit ridiculous. I'm happy to pay a premium price for a great game.  But $200+ dollars is the equivalent of 3 or 4 fresh triple A titles, each costing studios hundreds of millions of dollars developing.  Don't be fooled by the pricing scheme of Stellaris' base game and its DLCs.  It's nothing more than a disingenuous attempt to wring more money out of you than what the product is worth. Greedy developers like these make gray market websites seem justifiable.  It's a great shame because the game itself is quite enjoyable.  If you can buy all or most of the game on a massively discounted sale(70% or more) or an otherwise cheaper method, I would say it is worth your buck.

Recently Paradox has been pushing updates that have negatively affected a number of games made by them, but I will go into that later on the negative section of this review. Here's what I liked. Creating a custom empire: I love it, from both an RP and gameplay view it adds tons of different playstyles and options. Want to be a genocidal empire, do it. Want to be the melting pot of the galaxy, do it. Want to be Holy Zealots on an intergalactic crusade, do it. The Civic and Government system has come a long way since release, and it has been made amazing. This is strongly reinforced with a interesting species trait system that once again enhance both RP and gameplay, while allowing you to even minimax your species for your empire. Even the base portraits are pretty nice as are the namelist, while these are purely cosmetic and have zero impact on gameplay (barring what kind of compliments and insults you get from other empires), i'm sure many who enjoy RP would like this. A nice cherry on top is how mods can add even flavour and variety to all the areas mentioned above. Space combat: The part system can allow for a number of different ships beyond classes, support roles, glass cannons, ships beefier than a spacestation, carriers, cheap mass produced, expensive specific role ships. For those who like to minimax this is right up your alley. Ships sets are purely cosmetic, and have zero impact beyond the looks. The actual engagement of ships is not complicated like Endless Space for example. But as you play more, you begin to appreciate (or hate) the hyper lane system which can allow you to turn system into a fortress at certain choke points. Anomalies: What a great way to add incentive to explore beyond the hopes of finding and colonising a planet. Great for the early and mid game, small reward of credits and minerals, small research buffs lie at the smaller rewards. Other ends can be boast to planet productions of resources, uncovering new special resources that serve important roles in the late game, getting a free or some free progress on a tech. However some might not actually net rewards or benefits, adding a reason to remember the events and the correct paths. The risk vs reward is decently engaging. This also acts a way level up scientist and gain traits, both good or bad, Now I feel that is enough good points, there a few things i'm neutral on, such as the leader mechanics (Or lack thereof). But now onto the bad. DLC: Ah yes, cant talk about a Paradox game without talking about the DLC. I know what your thinking ""why is he talking about the DLC in the vanilla review"", well its because Paradox's approach to DLC means you buy the game so you can buy the DLC. Short take, its often a lot of money for mediocre things. There are some good DLC's in this game like Utopia and Synthetic Dawn adding some great mid to late game options and more Empire customisation. These two I would say are a must buy to enjoy Stellaris fully, the rest are such a bag of hit or miss, it is down to you to make up your mind. That being said, the base game is pretty much complete and playable, but its bland without the flavour added in from DLC. Planet invasions: Either bomb it to bits if its pointless or just spam a huge number of armies. And yes that is the level of depth for invasions. Updates: This may seem petty to do for a review, but this is something of a trend across all Paradox games I have played, the amount of reworks and changes. As I mentioned in the custom empire section, there were changes made for the better of the government. However there have been changes made to the space travel system, which was mandatory hyper lanes as before you could chose between hyper lanes, wormholes or warp drives, each having different strengths and weaknesses, the move to hyper lanes for all at the start of the game result in choke points, which I said you'll either or love. The change that has finally driven me to write an review and a bad one at that is the pop (population) change. Back in the old days, planted sizes dictated pop, so a 13 size planet had a 13 pop cap. This was changed as more simple city district system came into place, with now pop able to grow until you run out of housing on that planet. In order to combat performance issues Paradox's recent update has now added an effective empire wide pop cap, this results in stifling mid and late game colonisation. This means that mid late game structures such as Rings and Ecumenopolis (think Coruscant from Star Wars) now have little to no pop growth, these mid late game structures have just been made expensive vacant worlds with jobs to spare but no pops to fill. You could resettle pops, but this means having a negative impact on other planets economies, which then thanks to the cap can never be filled meaning there is no benefit to building these expensive or time consuming projects. Overall, Stellaris is a good base game, made better with some of its DLCs and with the workshop, but a majority of its DLC are bad to meh, some mechanics are so underdeveloped the might as well be removed, and some things needing mechanics dont exist. And lastly, Paradox might update the game which makes it less or more enjoyable. Thanks for taking the time to read!",Not Recommended,4424.0,660.3 hrs on record,Posted: 24 April

26,76561198089998922,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198089998922/,"I love this game but it needs to be said; with the release of Nemesis and the 3.0 patch it's obvious that Stellaris is dying. The end game lag due to engine's inability to deal with the total number of pops in the galaxy forced Paradox to hamfist some kind of fix. They did this by breaking the pop growth mechanics. Now one of the most efficent ways to continue growing pops in the late game is through continuous conquering or settling of planets (mind that many players hate using sector AI and dont want to micromange 30+ colonies), or using a ""feeder"" planet system. This seems to be where you have a series of halfway developed, low population worlds where all the growth happens and you ship those pops off to your ringworlds and ecumenopolises, as those won't grow at all on their own by the mid to late game, when you will be building them. I might be getting this ""feeder"" system completely wrong, but how it works isn't exactly my point. My point is, Paradox realized that the end game lag can't be fixed in engine, so they introduced a system that limits how much pop grows. The problem is that the way they did this either limits players to a specific playstyle (lots of colonies) or play in a way that is gamey and immersion breaking (never heard of designated breeder planets for a run of the mill scifi space civilization before). So what do I mean when I say Stellaris is dying, and what does all of what I previously said have to do with that? What I mean is that Stellaris has had so many features and mechanics piled on (good ones mind you, a ringworld with dense 80+ pops on each section is what you want in a grand strategy space sim) that it's straining the limits of the engine, and now Paradox are walking back parts of the game to make it run better. The capacity for the game engine to accommodate Paradox's creative ideas is at full, and most likely beyond it's capacity. It makes sense, as Stellaris is almost 5 years old. CK2 had it's last DLC 6 1/2 years after release; if Stellaris had the same lifespan we are a little over a year away from the death of the game in terms of new content. What I'm getting at is we need Stellaris 2. The original game was built with the old 25 pop max per planet system, and was never built to handle a more accurate pop system like the game has now. A new game built from the ground up with this greater complexity in mind is what should be happening; whether Paradox actually does it instead of trying to milk more money out of this iteration I don't know. CK3 and Imperator give me hope that Stellaris 2 is coming down the pipeline somewhat soon, but their antics with EU4 make me wary. Sadly, thumbs down as of 3.0; even though it was thumbs up from launch until right before the new patch. Mind you I haven't bought/played the new DLC or the new patch, but I've watched and read enough to thoroughly understand the new growth system and haven't touched it as it blew up the main way I play. Take what I say here with a bit of salt when it comes to the mechanic's details. My dissatisfaction with them is secondary to my concerns about the game's lifespan.

But their focus on additions instead of fixes have slowly worn this down to a negative. Every DLC adds in new shiny toys, and new ways to play, but breaks the AI further and further. If you're one of the minority that have a sizeable group of players to play with, you will more than likely not care. But for individuals like myself that play against the AI, having them be brain dead is a deal breaker. The AI is currently in a state where beyond the first 50 or so years of the game, it will offer no resistance to anything you do, even on the highest difficulty. Mods used to be able to rectify this, and combined with the in game difficulty settings that give then gigantic boosts to resource production, they were able to sometimes provide a challenge come mid game. But never late game. In all the time I've played this game, there has never been a single starting AI empire that has survived crashing and burning beyond mid game. So while I will miss this game, and it has so much potential buried within, the single player experience is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I can't for the life of me recommend it anymore.

41,76561198030642393,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030642393/,"Before I go into the reasons I can't recommend this game, I will say that there are many aspects of this game that are simply marvellous.  This is a beautiful game, with a rich story I haven't seen in 4x sci-fi games before.  The tech tree is interesting and well fleshed out, with research that can truly feel like you are shaping the society you are building.  The AI isn't completely stupid, and unlike many games I've played, they make relatively understandable choices when it comes to diplomacy (though they still sometimes will pick a fight they can't win)  There are a lot of options when creating your race, and it feels like there are a lot of societal differences that are meaningful, and not as shallow as ""more research"" or ""better attack""  The art and soundtrack are good, the writing is good, and the user interface is pretty friendly. So why don't I recommend this game?  I'm sure these themes will be familiar if you've read other critical reviews of this game: 1)  The base game feels incomplete, and a number of the features that come with the DLC feel like they are features that really should have been part of the base game.  They would have been better served to simply not have certain mechanics in the game at all rather than have a bare bones version (e.g. federations, espionage) that is effectively useless without the relevant expansions.  They also plant the seeds for events and development that simply goes nowhere (or perhaps only goes nowhere until you have the relevant DLC)  One example I'll give is AI research.  The game warns you that certain AI technology is dangerous, but as near as I can tell, without certain DLC there is nothing in the game to MAKE them dangerous (i.e. having AI revolts, or having them seek independence) 2)  It feels like the end game hadn't been thought through.  I played a race through to the point where I have technologically ascended, and I was looking for a win condition there that simply wasn't there.  It feels like the technology trees run out long before the game does.  And there doesn't seem to be any win condition outside of galactic conquest. 3)  Combat.  I understand that options are limited given it is a real time game, but it's hard to see what's happening in combat, and just as importantly, why your fleets are winning or losing (are my weapon choices ineffective?  Is there a particular type of attack my opponent uses that I lack a defence for?)  This information is SORT OF there if you dig, but a more detailed breakdown would be helpful. 4)  Ship Design:  I also have a personal beef that the game auto-designs your ships for you, but makes odd choices at times, at times choosing weapons or systems that are vastly inferior to other ones researched (e.g. lv1 mass drivers instead of the lv3 lasers or missiles), and you have to turn off auto-builds entirely to be able to create a unique design of your own.  It would be much easier to manage a fleet if you were able to tweak the auto-designs, or to be able to have your own unique designs in parallel to the automatic ones.  There is also no way to save or copy designs that I could see. 5) Race types:  Though they give a generous range of options for your race, there is one aspect that is only cosmetic and could have added a bit more depth:  species.  You can choose humanoid, avian, fungus, etc., but that particular choice is only cosmetic.  It would've been interesting to make different categories of race have an impact on game play, if only by offering one or two unique technologies, or other minor tweaks.  This is a minor beef though. There should have been a ""season's pass"" option, or simply offer the DLC at a price lower than the base game itself.  It's frustrating to feel like you don't get a complete game without the DLC.  DLC, in my opinion, should be for adding new/additional content, but not mechanics that feel more-or-less essential to the experience.",Not Recommended,3199.0,346.5 hrs on record,Posted: 9 July

43,76561198011212700,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011212700/,"I have to say, I don't get it. I've never quite understood the love for this game. It's a fine product with very good visuals for a 4X game as well as a top-notch interface. The polish on Stellaris is undeniable. But under that shiny skin is a game with the depth of a shaving bowl. To start, I love Paradox games. I've poured many an hour into EU3, CK2, EU4 and haven't yet purchased CK3 because I value my marriage. I am a sucker for SF games and it remains one of my consistently favorite genres of games. But Stellaris isn't it. I tried to like it. I really did. Long after I found the game beyond boring (about 15 hrs in when I figured out the core gameplay loop will never change), I stuck with it for another 40 hours. Hoping, wishing there was more than I found. There wasn't. So let's talk about it a little. The main problem I have with the game is the loop. Here's every single loop of every single game of Stellaris you will ever play: - Send an explorer vessel to neighboring system (put it on auto-mode, really). - Discover anomaly - Investigate anomaly - Receive random anomaly story - Build outpost in system - Send mining ship to system and build every extractor and mining facility you can - Move to next system - Colonize a system as you can - Repeat for thousands of hours That's it. That's the game. I wish I were exaggerating. In 60 hours of playtime, this is the only thing I ever did. I never made a choice. I never actually DID anything. I simply sent my ships to the next star, built an outpost and some mines, and maybe colonize a system. At some point, you hit your cap of how much outposts you can build. You'd think that maybe this is where choices start to matter and the ""expansion"" part of things is over? Nope. Just research a technology to make that pool of points larger and start the process again. Hit another wall, research again, and continue. At some point, you do this enough that you've filled up the entire map as much as you can and are now running into your neighbor's borders. It's at this point the game really gets boring. See, up until now at least you were very minimally doing something. But now you just sit there and.... well nothing. You sit there and stare at the screen. You can declare a war. I guess. Wars boil down to this: Build as many ships as you can. Make sure it's more than your opponent. Meet them at whatever choke point exists between the two of you. Bigger navy wins. Take a few planets (which is very much like colonizing just with lasers). And.....that's it. Congratulations, your space zone has increased a little bit and you can go back to staring at the screen for countless more hours. The anomalies are pretty cool at first. They hint at some nice atmosphere and depth to the game. But after you've scanned your 300th anomaly in the core loop and seen the same thing pop up a dozen times, it gets pretty stale. Yes, there are other things you can ""do"". You can genetically modify races. You can build buildings in your colonies. You can fine tune population designations. Those are all things that exist in the game. But here's the thing: None of it matters. At all. All races are the same and ultimately the little bonuses and desires they have don't matter because your tech research will be more powerful than the modifiers. Making a planet into an economic juggernaut doesn't matter because, once again (and I can't stress this enough), the only thing you'll ever be doing is Explore-Scan-Move on. So you make 4,000 credits a turn? You're still just going to Explore-Scan-Move on until you're at your limit and then you'll do nothing more than simply stare at the screen and watch your credit pool grow. Oh, and you'll always always always build and colonize 100% of everything available to you. There's no trade-off for doing so. What you're ultimately playing is ""fog of war eraser"". Remove the fog of war, push 100% of the little buttons that exist in the newly revealed area, and move on to reveal the next fog of war. Repeat until you stop playing the game. Again, I wish I were making this up. So all of that ""depth"" people rave about is not depth. It's window dressing. It's covering up one of the worst game play loops I've ever experienced in a game. You'll never make a decision other than ""should I build this type of mining facility first, or the other one?"" (Again, you'll always always always build them both so this isn't really a decision). So that's the loop, let's talk a little about other negative aspects of the game. - Not sure how to put this, but it feels very soulless. I think this is a problem with most space games, however. CK2 and EU4 has charm. You feel like you're in old Europe trying to tame the dirty peasants and their problems. Stellaris you're just kind of... there. In the void. - The game is extremely slow. Look, I don't play FPS at all and rarely an RTS. I don't need fast twitch games. But honestly you could boot up Stellaris for 2 hours and do LITERALLY nothing but stare at your screen that entire time on max speed. - Nothing of consequence happens. Ever.  Those anomalies and random events? Almost everything in the entire game is ""small random good modifier discovered"". So all you really do is just click ""confirm"" thousands of times. (Again, no choices in this game). It really gets stale fast. - No story. I know, it's a Paradox 4X game. But EU4 has a flow and story for each country in the form of decisions, story events, and random trigger chances. CK2 has story in that you have a family tree and can somewhat role play your way through it. Stellaris? Every single entity in the entire game is just ""inconsequential resource #___""  The president you just elected? Random resource. Fleet captain? Random resource. All those techs that make your people live longer? Now my random resources don't get replaced by almost identical other random resources as frequently! (yay?) Let's talk about at least one positive: The tech tree is amazing. I don't think I've ever seen a tech tree quite as good as this one. First, it's huge. That's awesome. Second, the way it branches and the little purple techs that get thrown in by chance is very well done. This is the only part of the game that will actually change at all from play through to play through. It's very well done. (Another positive might be the race editor if that's your thing. Since races don't matter at all, not sure why everyone raves about this). Ultimately, it's the worst Paradox game ever made by far. You may enjoy it if you're good at making stories out of watching paint dry or you want to boot up a game, put it on max speed, and walk away from your computer for several hours just to see how things develop.

Can you play it for hours on end? Yes, but then I look back and think of how it was only filler fun instead of actual fun. While fun when you don't know what to expect, you'll quickly realize that the gameplay is just so shallow at the end of the day. Every system is so basic and one-dimensional that you're just playing the exact same style of gameplay regardless of what kind of empire you've built, seriously. Your robot collective (because you can't even be robots without a collective?) will play almost identically to a fast-breeding space bug swarm, except one farms food and one doesn't. Empire building is hardly there, diplomacy is just awful with the AI, and you research the exact same stuff in the roughly exact same order every time. It's a game that is basically just for wars, but then why is combat so bad? There is almost no strategy at all. Defend a chokepoint (of which there are so many for a space game, because ""lane travel only""), and build a higher strength number than your enemy. Smash the fleets together, one wins, repeat. There are no real types of ships, just bigger ships that just do more damage and nothing else. Worst of all, they constantly ""overhaul"" the gameplay and somehow make it worse. Population growth was seen as a mid/late game issue where it got too high. So their idea to fix this was to add a poorly thought out empire pop cap (not planet) and just threw away most of the planet building slots that were tied to population levels. Except, they didn't remove the high pop requirement for the good buildings so you just build some stuff on your best planets and like nothing everywhere else, because there is nothing to build when you have no workers? In what world is just removing a whole gameplay feature, replaced with a shoddy patchwork for a replacement, a fix to a problem? Not to mention this breaks any mod that worked around buildings, which commonly happens to mods due to terrible reworks of gameplay. Overall, if you have a friend who owns the DLC, you can get it for $10 and probably have fun for a bit. Hey, even without the DLC you maybe can get a bit if fun, but since there is so much DLC and you'd have to sink so much to experience all the shallow systems to make the game slightly less boring overall, it's just not worth it. Such a shame because you can really see how this game could be amazing if they actually put some real effort into it, and not the lazy dlc sold for full price and half-baked revamps thrown in to make the game even less fun.

What else do you expect from a Paradox game? ------- Stellaris uses an engine pretty similar to Crusader Kings 2/3, real-time rather than turn-based. Unlike Crusader Kings however, Stellaris is a 4X and not a grand strategy game. That means ""explore, exploit, expand, exterminate"", games like Civilization. As a 4X, Stellaris doesn't hold well to it's competitors. The main culprit is the real-time gameplay. Real-time really doesn't work well with micromanaging each individual planet, starbase and military unit, especially not in the late game if your empire gets really big, It's a major chore for players who are heavily into the ""exterminate"" part of 4X. The game is more manageable if you build ""tall"" and dense empires rather than ""wide"" empires. There  is no ""win"" condition, you win by collecting points. Unfortunately those points are skewed towards how big your empire is and no points are given for how cultured they are. So if you were hoping to win the game through culture/diplomacy/economy/whatever before your empire is overrun by the enemy fleets... you can't. Having said all that, Stellaris sets itself apart through it's unusual civics/ societal ethics, and how that affects game-play. Your race/empire is customisable, and that customisation opens up a lot of possibilities. Be it a typical utopian dream,  a decadent empire which keeps a subservient slave race,  a mafia conglomerate, aliens that breed like cockroaches, a holy empire ruled by god-kings, Communism in space; there are all sorts of funny combinations to try which have their own strengths and weaknesses to play around with. So this game is better for role-playing weird and wonderful empires with their own little quirks, rather than as a competitive 4X where the goal is simply to min/max the most broken empire combination possible. Flavour and role-play over balanced, competetive play. I mean, it's a Paradox game. What did you expect?",Recommended,1726.0,362.1 hrs on record,Posted: 6 July

No new income from works.  Production flat lines or goes down as fleet power increases.  Tech slows down as costs go up but tech production does not.  Everything just grinds to a halt.

Base game + enough DLC to actually play the game is minimum 100€ and just to learn how to play and have a decent view of what its gonna be is more than 2 hours so don't expect being able to call refund. The early game is good. Exploration, colonisation, establishing contacts.. its fun and satisfying. You see the countless stars around and you just melt in it, also the little events are fun and endearing. Then your empire grow bigger. The only difference between the 1st, the 3rd and the 10th hour of a campain is the ammount of micro tasks you have to perform, but its the exact same things, and there is TONS of meaningless, not satisfying, micro tasks to do. Like building the same bases and mining post on ALL your systems, one by one, loosing your ship on the map and trying to find them back on the bloated UI with narrow eyes. Economy and faction management in general : The AI is just too bad at managing your economy, as it takes inhuman decisions, probably good in theory, calculated over the next 100 years, but awfull in practice as your ressources fly up and down every month, so you have to do it yourself if you don't wanna feel like a bot, and its not fun or satisfying at all. So many micro mechanics, too many layers and sheets, too many popups, the UI is unclear and it gets worse by the time  and its VERY repetitive. You are not having fun, you're just performing, trying to catch up as the more you empire grow, the more of the same micro tasks needs to be done and the immersion just completely vanish, you don't see the stars anymore, just a bunch of numbers. The AI is having more fun than you realy. Strategy and tactics : I haven't play for 1000 hours but for what i saw the way and only way as you start weak compare to the AI is to play defensive until you get sronger, via hundreds of years of researches. There is nothing to do during a battle, just watch the numbers.....its just about how's got the bigger number before the K : Fleet (A) 5K power VS Fleet (B) 10K power = Fleet (B) win but lose half its ships. There is no tactic. Small ship, Medium ship, Large ship, Your Mom ship.. you just get more fleet power, they all do the same. You can easily have a look on your enemies forces so its just dumb ; if you have a smaller fleet, just dont attack and stack more ships. Usually you go at war late game, and its terrible. Once you throw your big fleet out of your chokepoints and break through the enemy 1st lines, the ammount of meaningless micro task just explodes ; you progress into your enemy territory, dozens of front opens and it's just a matter of how much ship you can rebuild, stack and throw to the battle to keep progressing.

I will win in approximately 6 uninterrupted hours if nothing forces the game to autopause.  Oh no, an event!  The game freezes.  Phew, it was just the results of a survey of one of the few remaining unexplored systems and not a crash to desktop.  The galaxy has been divided into two federations. I have been insulting the strongest member of the other federation for years and they finally broke their treaties with me.  Once the the non-aggression period ends, approximately 1 hour of real time on the fastest setting, maybe the AIs in my federation will allow me to declare war on our rivals.  Probably not. +++++++++ Stellaris is a fantastic, addictive and deeply flawed game.  I wish there was a maybe button for recommending it to others.  Clearly I've found something within it to engage me for 292 hours of gameplay.  Early game exploration and discovery is fun.  Managing early events and choices are fun.  Choosing how to develop a world is fun. Designing new species is fun.  Choosing the loadout on ships is fun, in theory.  Ultimately, however, the design choices do not feel too impactful.  All species regardless of origin or ethics have access to the same modes of travel and identical technology options and so they all basically play the same.  The rock, paper, scissors dynamic of kinetic, energy or missile weapons preferences was patched out years ago so the AI builds the same units regardless and I cannot see attempting multi-player for a game that literally takes several days of time to resolve.  So your design choices are basically forced into general purpose ships that are good at everything and great at nothing. Midgame crises can be interesting.  They certainly has forced me to restart many times when I failed to tech rush fast enough to counter the Grey Tempest or the Great Khan's expanding territory.  Endgame crises were, once upon a time, another hard reset early after the game launch.  However, in their current state, they are meaningless speed bumps that occur too late to have any impact.  Yes, there are sliders to pick when these crises fire off The real challenge comes from the game entering an unwinnable lag state where no empire threatens you, the endgame crisis has been pacified and you basically spend hours waiting for the game to clock to the end.  Something about populations checking for available jobs and each check just drags the processing out.  So by having a large population, you end up too laggy to play.  Except without a large population, you cannot field a large enough fleet to reach the endgame, nor would you have enough researchers to tech rush hard enough to have the necessary tools to fight in the endgame.  There are many other reviews and posts that document the specifics and unfortunately they are true. I have never won or finished a game of Stellaris.  Once upon a time that was because it was genuinely challenging.  Now that I can handle the intended challenges within the game, the problem is Stellaris itself.  This game has much potential.  Again, the early game is fantastic and diverse.  The developers appear to love the game and keep updating it and creating new content for it.  The modding community is huge and creative.

The problem is, it's incredible boring looking at numbers and modifiers the whole game. I get the feeling it's as fun as doing your taxes. Stellaris gives you the sense that something will happen, that you will be engaged in this new & wondrous universe, reading what's to come, etc. After exploring the vast galaxy of different exciting number! You'll find yourself wondering if you missed something... again, because you're bored to tears. Yes, there are events in the game, great! How often is it that you find yourself just closing pop-up windows as if you have a trojan virus, with *insert boring stats here?* You know what? If I wanna read about sci-fi that has little to zero impact on the gameplay, besides meaningless buffs or nerfs, I'll pick up a book. I can't understand why they couldn't make it more about the species, other-worldly organic effects that might have on your planets, fleets, or population. Yes, they do have all the animations that give you the impression you are encountering new life-forms, but they all operate under a similar platform, which is our economy. It's bloody space! Would it kill them to be a little more creative, honestly? I know why, because this isn't a space game, it's a banking simulator in a guise of a sci-fi exploration game. Look, fun is subjective and for the people that enjoy the economy part of it, that's great. It's enjoyable to a degree, but the next time you start a game. Imagine all the stories, icons, policies and replace them with trucks, banks, mobsters and investors. See if you have the feelings you had for it before. I don't have all the answers, but hell. Have the tech be about what you discovered in the universe and be given the option to combine it with other tech that you found or researched. Maybe you can produce different outcomes, good or bad. You can try to make a new weapon but it turns into some kind of infecting symbiote. I know, but anything then a stat icon slog. Maybe that will make you care about what happens in the Sterallas universe. I always imagined this game being more rogue-like, never knowing what you're going to get. It would be more exciting in my opinion. Paradox combat system has never been it's strong point. I've played CK2&3, Stellasis, EU4. Whhhhy was blob 8 fleet afraid of 7 fleet? Because 7 ate 9. Is it really that hard to make combat in a video game more enjoyable? Somehow they've made me want to avoid it entirely. Oh wait, that's right. They have more micro managing for you to do in fleet design, which is equivalent of playing Tic-Tac-Toe with Paradox asking in the foreground, ""We having fun yet?"" Most games I've played in Stellaris consists mostly of expanding as large as I could min/max, turtle, hope the game either ends or my computer explodes. Unless some super powered fleet comes along and becomes an annoying game of cat & mouse, the game is basically over. Only you still about 10 or more hours of gameplay. At that point my mouse is already hovering over the ""exit game"" and into another lovely game of League of Legends and its teammates. I'm sure some of you know what I'm talking about. -_- In conclusion, inside Stellaris hies what could be one of the greatest sci-fi game to date.

Throughout the time I have played, though the game has been and continues to be massively overhauled in how it works.  Sometimes it is for the better, sometimes for the worse.  Overall, I honestly have mixed feelings about the game overall.  It is ambitious and there is nothing else that I have played that is so open ended for a space 4x type game.  Before the most recent update, 3.0.x, I would have given it an overall positive review and just highlighted some things to consider.  However, with the update, I can no longer recommend it in its current state.  Note that you can roll it back to an older build and mod the game, so if you want to do that, then sure, get it.  However, unless they refine what they have done, note that the current build completely breaks population growth.  In a 4x strategy game.  Before, population definitely grew too much and became a problem you just had to deal with.  Now, before hitting midgame, it takes 2 years to grow one population unit on an empty planet.  In other words, they fixed a leaking pipe with a sledgehammer.  This growth limit is due to a soft population cap for the entire empire regardless of how many worlds you own.  Which makes no sense in universe, and makes the game frankly frustrating to play.  This could be fixed by making the growth limit per planet and build in an S curve growth pattern, where the pops grow exponentially, as populations do, and then slow down when planetary resources get scarcer.  Limit how many habitats can be built with a soft cap based on upkeep, and you fix that problem.  It is insane how many  other ways it could be done.  But no.  I sit with 10 worlds: 5 of them are half full and 5 of them are virtually empty and it takes more than a year to grow one population unit.

And every time they do they go in the EXACT opposite of what the community wants. After the most recent patch they completely rebuilt the building system (AGAIN) forcing everyone to relearn the economy while utterly shattering it in the process By making your empire completely UNABLE to produce new citizens once you've got 3 or so planets developed. This makes the game entirely pointless beyond small-map head to head games now as if you play any larger maps it gets completely filled with 1 POPULATION planets that the game timer will literally END THE GAME before any of them breed a second pop. This makes the onliest strategy available, a warring zerg-rush, because whoever captures population, wins because growth is simply NOT an option. Now certainly they released a hot-fix, they heard the community and are backing this up right? wrong they are doubling-down. They've all but admitted this is permanent in their dev diary, but offered sliders to reduce the effect of the growth decline.... While simultaneously slashing the carrying capacity  of every planet you own, EVEN FURTHER. You either play there broken system, and never grow, or try to remove their horrible decision and get pop-capped rapidly by their newest bad decision. Ultimately saying, we are hard capping you to small galaxies, whether you like it or not. This is all in the name of ""Late-Game Optimization"" which... frankly wasn't god-awful, by the time you got that far the game was settled, you knew who was going to win if they hadn't decided to start steamrolling through the galaxy already so most generally would call it quits before the slowdown started. For anyone else, THAT'S WHY SMALLER MAPS EXIST!!!!! Late game optimization was something already purely in player control. simply play a smaller map, have fewer empires. Instead the whole game gets turned up on its head in the name of a total non-issue while Paradox outright refuses to acknowledge the real reason why this patch was so bad. The build system was fine, late game was fine, planets got to feel truly powerful and populous and now you cant even fill some planet types before the game literally cuts you off.

Now it just doesn't have the same appeal anymore. It's a great 4X-Space-Game with loads of content and an enormous amount of stuff to discover and try out, but it has some deciding flaws, which in my opinion got exacerbated over the multiple DLC's and patches. The degree of customization possible is enormous and the game allows for a lot of different playstyles, but this gets overshadowed by it's shortcomings. The first major problem is the AI. The difficulty settings merely alter the ressources gained by the AI and boost it's raw stats. There are no real dynamic relationships between empires, the AI will declare war if their approval is low anough and they have a chance to beat you. On higher difficulty settings, the AI will crush you in earlygame because of an unfair ressource advantage and will force you to play defensive. On all difficulties, but worse the lower you set it, the AI will fall off extremely hard in the midgame and stop posing any sort of threat to the semi-experienced player. And when you think the enemy AI is bad, your own colony-development AI is a thousand times worse. The next problem is the planet development. It started out being a little unintuitive and weird, now it is just a science in itself that is broken to use and basically offers shallow depth, with most buildings being just useless in most cases. Furthermore, the pacing is really off. Just really, really off. You have a well-done earlygame, expanding is a lot of fun and then you start steering your empire into a certain direction. As soon as you stop expanding though, get your special missions done, research all the anomalies and stabilize your borders, the midgame becomes super-boring. You have tens of years in-game time where nothing really major happens, story-wise. You just research, build your fleet and planets, clear some Leviathan's if you have the DLC. By this point, most AI-Empires start becoming weaker and will stop declaring war on you altogether, if they even went so far as doing that before in your playthrough. In the endgame then, you wait for the crisis to happen, but you do nothing really interesting in the meantime. However, if you expand by terraforming, building habitats etc., the micromanaging will become unbearable, since the AI is broken and useless. Suddenly, you have too much stuff to do, but it's not fun stuff, it's renewing your edicts, researching tech in increasing frequency, building infrastructure on your planet, and after some time it just gets tedious. To sum it up, yeah, the pacing is horrible in this game. Lastly, and most glaringly, the performance of the game suffers extremely, the longer the game goes on. Especially on larger galaxy sizes this becomes unbearable after the midgame. Kudos to modmakers, they add a load of enjoyment to this game.

The diplomacy system is very shallow, and combat is automated so un-fun as you have no ability to affect it besides how you build your army (with very few options), your first ships are useless until you randomly find the technology for the better ship models such as battleships or cruisers which could be over 10 hours into a game- the tech system choice of 3 different trees is an interesting one, but the randomness of it can also mean you are waiting hours upon hours for a critical technology to progress, and it means Stellaris lacks a coherent strategy that you can develop in other 4x games, and the randomness determines games. The pace of the game is the most frustrating part, with fleets taking minutes at a time to hop from system to system, so if a war is not in your immediate vicinity, you could be waiting 20 minutes just to move your fleet - and thats even on a tiny map! A strategy game being slower paced is not necessarily a bad thing, however each game in Stellaris lasts far past the limit of what is acceptable for such little progress to occur, and appears to have no options to change this. The game may seem complex at first, however you later find it's shallowness along with its many flaws, such as the economic system being unintuitive; the customisation all being just X% modifiers - all games play the same nomatter your race), the diplomacy is weak and pointless; it's story sections have little effect repetitive, boring, and simply too slow; federations being useless X modifiers again, and the galactic senate all just being %X modifiers (notice a theme?).

It's a complex game and the tutorial, unfortunately, does not even cover a small part of what you need to know.

Lastly its also an expensive game to get, I can honestly say that you don't need the DLC to play, but not having any means that you have less options to play with and the game can feel a little hollow.  If you can, only buy the DLC on sale - as the content per pack is very low for the asking price.

I personally enjoy (2), and I don't regret purchasing the game (I do have well over 1,000 hours in it). But I've probably spent an hour making mods or searching the workshop or forums or trying to fix mod incompatibilities for every two hours I've spent actually playing. There are just too many bugs and broken mechanics in the game for me to recommend buying it. 1) The AI is absolutely trash. It was OK with huge bonuses in 2.8, but it went into the dumpster in 3.0. You need mods to fix this. 2) There are too many gamebreaking bugs, like the invincible fleet bug. Some of these have been around for years. 3) The game is horrendously balanced. Some empire types are overwhelmingly stronger then others, which sucks most of the fun out of customizing empires. 4) Every empire plays pretty much the same (except some are just terrible, as noted above). All that diversity is mostly cosmetic. 5) The game is not stable. 3.0 overhauled a number of core mechanics 5 years into the development cycle. Every update means needing to rebuild mod lists, empires, etc, and introduces a host of new problems and bugs. You'd expect at this point that updates would just be new content, fixes, and optimizations, but there seems to be a perverse desire to completely overhaul the game. 6) The game is actively getting worse. Not only did the AI take a dive in 3.0, but both pop growth systems added are just horrendously over complicated and poorly thought out and implemented. Playing well requires ridiculous cheesy strategies like leaving all planets half-full and constantly releasing and re-integrating vassals. I used mods in 2.8 to improve the experience. I use them in 3.0 to make the game playable at all. 7) This is a high learning curve game. Not because of the complexity of the mechanics, but because the tutorial is awful, the UI is a mess, and you will spend a long time on wikis and forums looking for things before actually figuring the game out. 8) There are many useless, pointless, vestigial mechanics that exist only to annoy the player, like piracy, factions, gene modding, sectors, vassals, and planet automation.

The only strategic move you can make is decide which systems to attack in what order, with occasional cat-and-mouse chase going on. The strength of the stations is pathetic, even neutral fleets will easily overpower them. The idea of hyperlanes in space is hardly justified (although completely feasible as a concept), and so seems ridiculous, especially since all ships have ""emergency jump drive"" and will magically appear in their home system when retreating. Some of the random events in the game seem insanely unbalanced, like getting a machine uprising in the late game and suddenly half your empire is made out of evil robots who magically conjured massive fleets (multiple 100k strength fleets just spawned out of nowhere) - while also destroying most of upgrades on the stations for absolutely no reason other than to ♥♥♥♥ with you when (IF?) you reclaim them. Some starting traits don't make much sense, like the lost colony - all you get is a more advanced version of yourself you have to fight with because OF COURSE they will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to you. The tutorial is crap. There is no gradual complexity increase. You are thrown into the heat of it and the tutorial will go as far as tell you that ""this is a technology screen where you select technology"", ""this is a colony screen where you manage colony"" and other ""this floor is made out of floor"" stuff. It took me three games and several forum searches to figure out how to actually produce basic resources - if the auto-management wasn't there I would just give up there and then. Some resources got consumed in some mysterious ways, until I noticed that the upgrades of some core buildings started to eat resources that you may not yet have a steady income of. The default pacing is extremely drawn out. Things take forever to happen. Except for the AI who seem to just spread around like a plague and somehow keep up with my technocrat research despite being militarist imbeciles. The absence of key elements such as events log and tech tree is just stupid. I mean the game has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ music player, but a necessity of events history didn't occur to anyone? Some basic structure of research so that one can focus on getting ships, or stable economy? Nah, here's 3 random options in 3 ""directions"". And then there is the fact that the base game doesn't really stand on its own. Races you get are hardly varied. Only 4 ship classes, no Titans, no doom stars, no planet-busters. And it's not like the game is cheap either. Visuals-wise, there is so damn much light everywhere. You guys seen space right? It's mostly dark in the visible range. The galaxy map is so bright I was straining my eyes to see anything close to the center. But hey, you can zoom out so that the whole galaxy fits in your fist! In the end, the game not only feels unpolished (good luck balancing with the insane amount of details!) but also incomplete and even unfinished. I was hyped about this game for over a year, waiting because my old PC couldn't run it, only to be hugely disappointed.",Not Recommended,3429.0,40.9 hrs on record,Posted: 13 March
111,jenshae,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jenshae/,"Let me preface this by saying, at the time of writing this review, I have all of the expansions and have played in games with 7-8 players. Pros The base game is really good. Species creation, flavour and personality is excellent. The AI can put you under pressure for a long time until you get used to them. AI diplomacy is not bad (has room to improve), the different ways you can have allies, vassals and such is really good. The event chains are interesting, you can hover on the buttons to see what you get out of it and TL;DR them or you can enjoy these little stories. Cons So many latency and de-sync problems in MP. If everyone doesn't have fibre, 0 packet loss and a really good machine to crunch what they are sent and send it back in a timely fashion, it becomes a train wreck. From the outside AIs are good, however, if you let an AI play your empire, when you skip an evening, they cheat. Thus your economy will be a mess, the planets are a mess, the AI clearly gets resources from thin air and adjusting to that is a pain. I don't like the Federations DLC. I would like the option to host a game, where the Galactic Federations nonsense is not in the base game. It is more nuisance than fun. Nemesis DLC is ""meh"". We always had someone (different players) feeling compelled to be the Nemesis just because they had enough stars to nuke and were in a position to do it. It makes the game feel scripted and not truly dynamic interactions between empires. It also strikes me as rather puerile fantasy, ""Imma gonna nuke the WHOLE galaxy! Hurr! Hurr!

I don't mind the economy changes within the 3.0 update, even though it has changed game progression substantially. However, this update was sold to us as a way to reduce lag by reducing pops. It has, instead, seemed to do the opposite. Tickrates and time progression seems to have slowed dramatically. I'm unsure what is causing this, but compared to 2.9 and earlier, it is no longer viable to sit down and play a game in a reasonable length of time. I suspect the fog of war system and the amount of things now required to keep track of within the galactic map mode is a large contributor to this, as ticks progress far faster within system map modes. The latest update has broken many unique empire types - with anti-diplomacy civics (Inward Perfectionist) now able to interact as usual with other empires, Criminal Heritage bonuses causing more criminals, resulting in a loss in trade value, which results in less energy credit income for the CH - which is working the opposite as intended.

Stellaris foi lançado em 2016 no dia 9 de Maio, e desde então já recebeu múltiplas atualizações e mudanças drásticas que mudaram toda a sua fundação sem contar nas inúmeras DLCs. Um ponto muito forte de Stellaris são suas inúmeras possibilidades de gameplay, que além de dar escolha para os jogadores, são aleatórias em cada campanha, assim dando uma excelente rejogabilidade ao jogo além de uma experiência única, outra coisa que ajuda muito nisso são os mods, já que adicionam muito mais conteúdo ao jogo que já possui horas e mais horas de diversão. Uma coisa que Stellaris faz muito bem são eventos e histórias que você pode encontrar pela galáxia ao explorar, mesmo sendo um jogo de estratégia, esses pequenos pedaços de história é o que ajuda a dar vida a universo durante as jogatinas, esses eventos podendo ser desde uma ruína antiga com equipamentos de terraformagem, ou até mesmo gigantes colossais em alguns planetas, eles podem variar muito e realmente adicionam um elemento de variedade. Já um dos pontos fracos, é uma das coisas que não é incomum de se ver em um jogo da Paradox, as DLCs, que estão se tornando numerosas para Stellaris, mas o ponto positivo, é que diferente das DLCs de outros jogos como Europa Universalis, as DLCs de Stellaris não colocam sistemas essenciais atrás de paywalls, ou seja, não são conteúdo pago, um dos maiores exemplos disso sendo com a DLC Utopia, que adicionou a mecânica ascensões ao jogo base a não apenas para quem pagou. A gameplay do jogo é relativamente complexa, mas de modo geral é simples de entender, entretanto difícil de masterizar. Essa complexidade vem das diversas mecânicas que o jogo possui que vão desde a parte econômica, com suas porcentagens, números, controle da população, eficiência e várias outras coisas, até as ações militares, onde você pode construir uma frota dedicada a engajar um certo inimigo, tentar aplicar táticas diferentes, usar os efeitos dos diversos sistemas a seu favor e mais inúmeras possibilidades. No geral, Stellaris é um ótimo jogo de estratégia com poucos defeitos e com muitas possibilidades, e certamente merece uma chance.

180,liam25861,https://steamcommunity.com/id/liam25861/,"TL;DR: Don't buy, the games been out for almost 5 years now and is still broken, ideas are still half finished and overall the dev team has no real idea where they want to take this. This game since its initial launch has suffered, far worse then any paradox game. Every unique choice since start was stripped away slowly and standardized, from FTL travel options, the planetary management system (which is more micro but less effects overall in game), and then diplomacy/first contact. And you know what? That's fine. Plenty of games have done this before and ended up for the better, sometimes streamlining is good for the game. But it didn't fix anything, and it never gave a good alternative to what it removed and replaced it with.  The base game is still buggy as hell, and they've yet to improve on the base and instead put any mediocre/good ideas into DLC's making the games effective price in the hundreds of dollar. And make no mistake, barring Apocalypse and Utopia many of the ideas are half baked or just mediocre, but are nonetheless essential for many major mods for this game because the only way for modders to improve the system is to have access, because it's a unspoken truth that Paradox often won't fix it. Normally Paradox and other games have modders to fix the shortcomings of the game (and in this games case, to have a fun experience you often have to have mods.) however the modders always get the short end of the stick because their mods keep breaking every patch. I'm not just referring to every major patch, that much would make sense since core game-play features are being tweaked, no every .0.1 patch often has a high chance of just destroying entire mods for a time between 2 days-2 weeks depending on the skill of the modder and their own schedule to fix the mod. On top of that, the new launcher after downloading 60 mods (regardless of size) has a high chance of breaking meaning you need to uninstall your mods and resubscribe x number of times hoping each relaunch the launcher either detects them or decides to actually enable them. It's frustrating to see Paradox continue to do this to games, at one point when they were a smaller studio this would've been tolerated, but old paradox is far in the past, this company should be held to the same standard of any other large game studio/publishing group especially when the base game is still around 30-40$.",Not Recommended,1973.0,492.1 hrs on record,Posted: 18 April

The original 1.0 release saw a game that had the markings of a classic Paradox 4x game - different facets of administration (government ethics), factions, simplified resource management (two main types that are acquired in a not-roundabout way), base management in the form of population controls, etc. There was enough to keep you engaged, and assigning automated systems once your empire got large enough kept you going forward from there. Every aspect of the game was accessible from a tooltip or the advisor - there was no mystery as to how you got your resources and there was no myriad spiderweb of information to dig through to see why your population was being impacted by what was affecting it. Diplomacy was fairly straightforward, warfare was fairly straightforward, research..everything was accessible, and while there was a depth to it, you didn't need to search far for your answers. That has since changed. With the 3.0 update the top of the screen is now half-covered with information about different types of resources to manage; from the base two expanding out to the more amorphous types such as unity and administration. While you can construct buildings on your planets to seemingly affect these resource incomes..its not entirely clear what benefits are output from these buildings, or which buildings your populations now work in while 'jobs' are available, or how to get more mainstream administration to be able to increase the effective size of your empire...nothing is apparent any longer with how the 'game' functions and how best to 'exploit' any one of the myriad things you need to have in order to be successful. The in-game advisor gives a few sentences detailing what administration is, but never says how building administration buildings impact it, how to increase it overall, or...anything necessary to actually functionally PLAY the game at a high level. And so you're back to watching tutorials - fifteen minutes on every aspect of the game, until you're watching more tutorials than playing. Paradox. Stop doing this. Stop over complicating every single facet of every single game you create so that the player is so tied down in the minutia and tedium of micromanagement that the actual 'grand strategy' of the game is lost and completely bogged down by forcing the player to 'pay attention' to any of a dozen 'new' aspects of a game that weren't necessary. The original Stellaris was a great game - Stellaris as of 3.0 is a smorgasbord of interconnecting factors that each need to be micromanaged to be a successful empire, a dozen times over.

I love the way Paradox are handling its development as an ongoing effort over years and years and I don't mind to once in a while pay for extensions to a game that is constantly evolving and makes it difficult to devise the one strategy that will bring victory to your people since there are soooo many ways to play this game and they keep changing when new abilities and events get added. I also love the way that the game weaves story into something that is basically random in its setup and manages to interest you even though you get an event for the x-th time. And then there is multiplayer... I play the single player game as I would play a turn-based game. I do something, I start time, and as soon as something happens I pause the game to be able to take it all in... so I thought who would want to play this multiplayer without the constant pauses that a game like this requires... and now I know: It is no problem at all since everybody in the game that really participates has the same timing problem as you so it is also no problem to pause once in a while or lower the overall speed of the game to a manageable level, and we usually are on a chatline while playing the game and it is soo much fun to see the events pop up that others just got thrown their way or to help each other out in times of crisis and even if you don't see the others yet, the groaning about events that you already know about and the issues they run into an complain...

The game itself is absolutely wonderful to fans of the genre, offering incredible possibilities. It can be played in both single-player and multiplayer, depending on your preferences, so you can hop on with your friends and watch as the galaxy falls before your might. And while not having the DLC doesn't detract from your experience, the content they offer is awesome as well, so I suggest getting those if you can (The big three to get right now are Apocalypse, Utopia, and Megacorp, however, I would add Nemesis to that list once it comes out). If all that wasn't enough, the modding community is superb, with content ranging from new planets to making massive warships out of entire star systems. Now, speaking from personal experience, here's a few things you need to know. Firstly, the learning curve is a little steep. Paradox isn't the greatest at making tutorials, so learning to play using only what the game provides is going to take a while and a lot of trial and error. With that in mind, I suggest using the wonderful tool known as youtube to gain the knowledge you need to start off. There are a bunch of Stellaris tutorials ranging across all skill levels out there for your use. There are a lot of things that may be confusing at first, but they'll clear up with time. Secondly, there are a couple of things that may cause some lag, like generating large amounts of ai empires, hundreds of stars, and communicating with the players at the same time when starting a multiplayer game, or handling two 500k fleet power fleets in combat with each other. Finally, playing multiplayer with DLC or mods takes some tinkering, as servers must have the same version as the players within it. This game is amazing, it just takes some time.

Recommended to me by my friends because they knew I liked strategy games and they wanted another person to play with. Not knowing what I would get myself into, I bought the game with no DLC (mostly because my friend already had all of them) and I jumped into a game with my friend. If I remember correctly I played as a simple Human empire for my first game, and when the tutorial bot VIR showed up to tell me how to play the game, I asked if I should listen to the tutorial for my first game. My friend told me, ""Nah, trial by fire."", so I promptly clicked the option to 'Shut this thing down.' That first game was messy, but an absolute blast. Stellaris is a game I always come back to, even if it is just to play as a Megacorp bankrolling my friend into Galactic Ruler or a ""benevolent"" Robot research conglomerate who just wants to ""protect"" the galaxy with planet destroying super lasers. The most interesting thing I see in Stellaris is the ability to see new playstyles from people. While it may never be optimal to play as a bunch of slowly reproducing rock-people on a world that will explode sometime in the future, it will always be a joy to see how players figure their way into Stellairs. If you are a new player and you read this review, please stick through at least a couple games and learn what wacky ways you can play around in this galaxy. I won't lie to you, this game is quite complicated, but with enough time and effort, you can learn how to exploit your enemies and allies to become the seat of the Galactic Emperor or even forcibly takeover the largest alliance in the galaxy by giving them copious amounts of phones and apples. The last thing I want to talk about is DLC. I'll start by saying for new players, the DLC is immensely helpful in making things a little more complicated and fun. However, DLC is definitely pricey and for the most part I would wait till it goes on sale to buy it so you dont end up spending $100 just for the main 5 DLCS. If you have a friend that already has all of them like I did, you can just have them host your games and you can use all of them as well. That being said, I definitely recommend getting them if you can cause they add decent depth to the game and allow you to do some wacky things to the galaxy. As a note, MODS ARE A GODSEND, please find some you like and use them once you get a feel for the games mechanics. Thank you for reading this all the way through if you did, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone that has the time to sit and play strategy games.

Exploration becomes stale after a few games once you see all the anomalies since there isn't  interesting features like in Civ. A big warning sign should've been the games reliance on Crisis to create an interesting challenge. This is basically the equivalent of a Deus Ex Machina in bad stories. Because the ai is so bland and useless, a Crisis is used as a crutch (imo) to create interest.

The visuals and in depth story and complexity was fun an entertaining, enough to stave off the horrendously grindy nature of the whole dang game. As was the feeling of having to keep playing it constantly, cause the thing eats up time and you need to remember to pause it just to live your other noticable existence. But then nemesis came, and now the grind has become too much to deal with. I have no idea what Paradox Interactive thinks when they make their games: "" Let's make our gamess horrendously overcomplicated and thus neigh irritating and time consuming to play, and when we are unsatisfied with a particular aspect of how we coded our game can get around this slow, agonizing grind fest, lets code it to make it more complicated and irritating to deal with all the time, so that the person can never escape the horrible grind feeling that should come with all of our games!"" So it was with nemesis and their population growth now becoming slower as population increases later on in level. Now, I can understand why it might seem nice under the guise of game balance to do this, to make other builds I guess possible, but it has now made all modes of game irritating to deal with. And it is also still exploitable. Just pump out how many habitable planets that exist in the universes when you start, then colonize the crap out of them, and then just wait for those colonies to have about 4-5 pops, and then use the rest to send to your primary production centers. Even easier with the worm. All it does it make an already crazy micromanaging situation more micromanagement crazy, and still favors heavy breeding low migration builds, or high diplomacy builds that pull off ""greater than ourselves."" So yeah, wow... didn't really help the situation did it? Makes your whole idea of slowing population down to balance ♥♥♥♥ out just make things easier for those particular builds, meaning all the other builds just get screwed... even more. Great job paradox. Some great thinking there. Well I've had it. What was bearable, slow, progressive and consistent population gain now curves off too quickly to keep my interest. And the only option to keep up a viable defense fleet, particularly one capable of taking out the crisis, requires a frackton more micromanagement than I have the time or patience to keep me interested anymore. It was already pretty bad before. Now, it's just too much to remain interested. There are some people who do not want to spend their whole afternoons trying to figure out how to play a game over and over and over again, especially if the adjustments completely tank how to play the game already, and make it an even more boring experience.

Graphics (especially loading screen) are beautiful. The problem with this game is that it offers poor replayability. It is one of these games which are addicting, but not fun. After about 100-120 hours (about 3-4 runs) it offers nothing interesting and you are left with DLCs, which get boring quickly too, and are insanely expensive. This game bears heavy resemblance in gameplay to early Civilization. That is it takes the worst aspects of it. Excessive micromanaging, however here you micromanage planets instead of cities, but it is exactly as tiring as it was in Civ1 or Civ2, it feels like a chore honestly. UI is awful (Paradox trademark sign), you need to dive really deep into menus + some really poor design choices like no separate button for removing trade deals, which gets infuriating often. Also, tons of messages that you don't really care much about (survey finished, ships upgraded) Economy, despite being focus of the game is really shallow. Classic planned economy, just like in nearly every video game, one would expect at least some elements of market economy if developers focus on economy, but no, just good ol' Soviet Union. You have to build every single district and building yourself, advisor is worthless, and will only make more mess. In the end, economy boils down to converting all your resources into Alloys and Research. Multitude of various resources add nothing to game, because you can easily trade every one of them. Exploration gets boring quickly, after first run you know nearly every anomaly and star name in the game. While art is beautiful it is quite scarce. How often one can look at Mars-like landscape when you get Terraforming Candidate planet, not every planet is Mars. AI is brick, after initial early game, where randomness may help gain him head start there is no challenge. Despite insane bonuses (+100% resource output on highest level) it still plays really poorly, and even casual player will have no problem defeating it. Warfare is tedious, long-lasting and unrewarding, especially when you see your completely devastated enemy having 8% war exhaustion. If you don't set AI Aggressiveness to high, you will rarely ever see anyone attacking you, because AI is simply too weak anyway. There are also some poor game design choices, for example workplaces constantly look for pops to work, not the other way that is people searching for a job. It creates insane lag in lategame and it was patched with another poor decision to artificially limit amount of pops empire can have. So now, war is only way to expand your empire from mid-game on. Unless you change settings and let lag pour in. Probably poor AI was the reason behind Endgame Crisis, just spam tons of spaceships and call it a day. That's how you increase difficulty. Yay! And that's why I turned this off in my games. It feels really artificial, every game is focused from the start on building several late-game >100K armada. Same goes with Fallen Empires which are OP empires with several doomstacks of spaceships and scarce lore behind it. Absolutely wasted concept. Science fiction element is bland and shallow. Planets have several classes and that's it. No temperature, or crust composition, sorry. And once again, micromanagement in this game is insane.

You find that you are enjoying the world in ways you haven't before, but then suddenly in your gleeful wandering you are ran down by a steamroller in the street driven by the staff of Paradox themselves. Steamrolled. Then you reincarnate as some nerd who eventually gets into gaming, then you buy Stellaris and then you start it up only for the cycle to repeat. You go through it all again. Your luck doesn't line up again. And you suffer the same outcomes again. But you never learn, and you keep coming back.

Don't get me wrong, there are a TON of choices, but they all feel like filler or lack the context necessary to make a good decision. So much of the game feels like it was designed to generate additional clicks to pad out the experience and the time I spent on it felt like a chore.

You carve your own path, sending your nation from humble begginings down the road of history, ethier to success or failure. Trial and tribulation is integral to this game: it is so easy to fail if you aren't paying attention, giving weight to your action or inaction. This, conceptually, makes it in my opinion WAY more compelling than shorter ranged games (such as, again, Hearts of Iron). It really isn't hard to be successful, but it is easy to lose, BADLY. This game does have a couple of problems however the main one would be the concept of DLC, and how it really is abused by Paradox to essentially scam players by driving up DLC prices. The vanilla experience does not capture the full scope of the game AT ALL, and often makes it buggy and sort of underwhelming. This is easily counteracted by just getting the DLC, but I reccomend waiting until a sale to get those. These new DLC, however, constantly are adding new mechanics to the game, stacking layers upon layers of depth to your gameplay expierience, and further allowing you to immerse yourself into this alternative history grand strategy game.

Peace is the way forward and all that. This however was not a sentiment my neighbour shared and he figured my little fleet of corvettes and some cruiser I found in a dumpster were easy pickings, so claims were made and no agreement reached. First round went to me thanks to my little cruiser buddy and the disputed area was added to my domain. All were well and I was still bumming around when the second stage of the economy management came crashing into my life like and abusive stepmother. Energy credits and metals in the reds. I had made a bit of a woopsie in my eco-planning and the alloy production was through the roof and upkeep were swiftly raising with no clear explanation. My selfdeclared rival was watching and decided round two was on and thus a fleet three times as large as last time came knocking on my door. My not so impressive fleet was attempting to fall back to get the latest improvements installed when they got caught leaving a system and forced into a battle suffering a humiliating defeat at the hands of a smaller fleet. This is when I to my great relief found that defeated fleets aren't wiped from existence but return to their home base after a while. This is when the gate near my homeworld activated and let through a swarm of vermin taking out my main starbase and locking production of warships in the system. Enemy offered peace in his favour claiming all previous territory, but that's not how we do things here, I might be poor and beaten and under temporary occupation, but I still had my previous chokepoint and some income from food and I think it's entertainment? Selling this in the internal market I scraped up a new fleet corvette fleet with a heavy focus on rapid fire and shields based on what I had been able to glean from the one-sided massacre previously. Noticing the enemy had divided its fleet into four parts that were hypothetically manageable I decided to make this a bit of a larger operation and attempt to engage them all separately and claim victory through local superiority and better logistics. My cruiser flagship fit for fight again and with a new escort with the latest technology and designs set out again to reclaim our lost systems. This is when I found out to my great annoyance that you can't micro a fleet locked in combat and my little flagship and its admiral was lost forever in the void when the enemy reinforcements arrived to turn the table on me. Another offer of peace was extended but it seems the AI still weren't quite clear on just how uncooperative someone can be. So what if my lovely flagship was space dust? So what that my economy had gone from bad to even worse (food was running low as well now)? So what if I can't build modules on my planets because I'm resource locked? So what that my fleet is 1/5 of its original strength and my best admiral dead? So what that the enemy fleet is 12 times stronger and three times larger than my own fleet capacity? I still have my chokepoint (that's in NO way up for the task of keeping the enemy out), some income good enough to stave off complete ruination. And. I have my scientists. The true secret weapon of my race. And they delivered just what I needed. In short order all three delivered, increased food production to stabilize the population, a new shield design and best of all: Destroyer class ships. With new designs to rip enemy corvettes to shreds I once again embarked on the mission to rebuild my fleet. After finally figuring out how to use the damn trade hubs and the boosts I got my Energy Credits back from red and expansion into a new sector bumped the metal production to at least a manageable loss instead of a crippling one. The enemy however hadn't been idling either, the fleet they now had in the area was still one and a half times larger than my own fleet capacity and roughly twice as strong. They even had started implementing their own Destroyers. After a few clashes that left both fleets severely mauled I also incorporated a few heavy hitter designs and so my fleet started coming out on top despite enemy reinforcements and being outnumbered. The rival who previously issued peace from a position of claiming victory started asking for peace from status quo, with me holding ~2/3 of my previously lost areas. These offers were all declined and I was preparing to drive the enemy out of their last occupied system and push passed their own chokepoint into the real meat of their empire. With my new second fleet inbound to my soon to be liberated system and my main fleet pounding at the enemy starbase, both sides declared peace due to war exhaustion. Second round ended because the bell rang. This did not go over well with the Mimerian (my custom race) elite who had been working tirelessly for years to negate the economic crisis and raise the fleets for action. A faction formed that claimed Mimeran supremacy and all alien life is inferior to them. But whatever motivates them to work harder is fine by me, I still had a score to settle with my rival after all. During peace time the Mimerians focused completely on war preparations and trading insults with the now declared rival, new breakthroughs led to the development of Disruptor tech and the allseeing overmind that is me saw that this was indeed VERY good. The new cruiser design that were implemented relied heavily on either Disruptors or a combination of Energy Siphon and Plasma. To compliment the now very thinly stretched first and second fleet a third fleet was added to assist in the expansion towards the edges of the galaxy. Since all they were expected to fight were rouge elements of drones and such they were both fast firing cruiser designs. During this time we received an emergency call from some people apparently having been taken hostage by pirates who set up shop just outside my borders. So my the new pride of my fleet got to test their mettle in a rescue mission between two fleets equal in strength but outnumbered  4-1. It turned out to be a bit of a mistake. Seems like Disruptor weapons are VERY bad at recognizing hostage from pirate and my goal was disintegrated along with their captors. Oh well, at least the weapons worked fine. At this point I realized that the time for peace had passed and put down claims on ~1/3 of my now declared rivals territory, splitting his empire in two. Since he hadn't moved on from Destroyers yet his combined fleet was roughly equal to my now reformed and massively bolstered first fleet. Not wanting to take chances I spent the time taking out his systems while getting the second fleet up to strength. When the enemy split in two to retake the systems I had claimed both first and second fleet joined forces and completely shattered both enemy fleets in two grand battles that left me the undisputed victor. (Lost ~5-10% of strength each battle), and with third fleet falling back and defeating a splinter fleet pushing towards the edges victory was undeniably mine and the enemy surrendered all claims and gutted themselves in the process, expanding my empire by ~30%. Then the free weekend ran out. TL:DR Ended up a bullying warlord because resources are nice and the enemy were weak beyond redemption.",Recommended,6032.0,483.8 hrs on record,Posted: 27 May

However, keep in mind that this is a Paradox Interactive game so you will need to spend at least $100 on DLC in order to get fun out of it.

335,76561198000876905,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000876905/,Decided to try the game during the free weekend. I love Homeworld/Star Wolves/Surviving Mars/Two Point Hospital series and this game is quite different - there is so much more micromanagement which I initially found boring for space games as I prefer more action. For example you start with being able to make only corvette class ship and it isn't known how to make/research more type of ships. I have a feeling this takes a lot of time. The research always gives you three new options but they are not really related to ships that much. There is no tutorial as the game just gives you explanations when you click on stuff. It doesn't tell you how to build mines on planets or if it does it's way too easy to miss. Good luck capturing an enemy planet with corvettes earlygame! Made 1k power fleet of like 25 corvettes and it takes ages to do just 10% damage on fastest speed. There is no explanation given if I am doing something wrong or why is it so slow! I doubt the enemy ground army will hug my colonization ship if I try to send it there... And I lost the war due to this slow pace - well dunno what to do and the tutorial doesn't explain it. P.S. - Surprisingly I decided to buy the game as I wanted to play it just two days after placing this review... And I played a lot... So I decided to change my rating to a positive one :). The game has so much to it but the base version doesn't seem to justify the 40 price tag I would say and it's marketing it's DLCs a lot. There is no campaign/scenario but there are so much small events and a global endgame crisis and so much settings/randomizations that it has a ton of replayability.,Recommended,1328.0,259.4 hrs on record,Posted: 23 May

345,vi3txrangerx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/vi3txrangerx/,"If you enjoyed other Paradox Interactive games, specifically Cities: Skylines or Surviving Mars then I believe you will really enjoy this game. There are some similarities from those games but this game itself is a sim builder / economy manager with space ship fights for fighting over key resources and Star systems. I like to think this is a mixture of Catan and civilization with space ship fighting. You also engage in diplomacy with other nations. How you approach them is up to you, and can affect how things turn out for you or your neighbors. This game is also multiplayer; You can save the game just like a single player game and load it up like a single player game, allowing you to pick up where you left off with your friends. However, games can take a few days to finish so it can be challenging to get everyone on to finish games where there are more than 2 or 3 people. At first, the game seems pretty overwhelming. The UI holds a lot of information and the tutorial isn't a typical tutorial where it holds your hand throughout the game. Expect your first game to be the tutorial. As you explore and play the game, the tutorial intermittently plays when you encounter something new to you (e.g. a federation, research tab, species tab, etc.). After a few hours the game isn't overwhelming and much more manageable. This is where you start gaining traction and you can really enjoy the game. Although it can be tempting to look up guides online to figure out how to play, I highly suggest just playing the game and figuring it out as you will learn much faster that way. Overall, this game is very addicting. I've actually stopped playing all other games to just focus on this game. There is a ton of content and the different builds of empires and situations you can run into makes the game consistently fresh and never boring. If you enjoy RTS and economy management, I highly recommend getting this game.

Utopia lets you, for example, make your species Psychic, or lets you drastically alter the genetics of the various species you meet.

Most my playthroughs are very enjoyable with interactions with the all the different empires, and expanding my own empire in the process. However, even after almost 800 hours in this game, half of my games will still end being wiped out by some end game crisis I probably wasn't ""truly"" ready to deal with in the first place, but it's all good. I usually just start up another game right away and try again, and when you do get a true victory it is very, very satisfying. Stellaris has a deep learning curve and the do change the gameplay mechanics as new DLC's are added, so you'll have to adjust your gameplay every once and a while. Which is fine by me, it keeps the game interesting. I know a lot of people complain about the changes they make to game sometimes but I wouldn't let those complaints stop you from trying the game out yourself.

According to advice from the player base, this game is all about micro managing, and boils down to doing nothing but micro-managing every little thing. EVERY. LITTLE. THING. Graphically, it's about as beautiful as a shiny turd. You'll spend very little time looking at the graphics, and when you do, there is nothing fascinating about it. If you any game from the Halo 3 era, you've seen the best these graphics will ever have to offer. The A.I. is garbage. It really is. The enemy civ A.I. is garbage. Your ship intellegence is garbage. If you try to have the A.I. automatically run one of your planets it is garbage. The A.I. is there to mass produce whatever ships they can and throw them in your direction. If you encounter an aggressive A.I. player early on (let's face it, the A.I. will either be aggressive 90% of the time, or they won't really care about you) and they declare war with you, they will send out roughly 60 of the same ship at you. Once you have their fleet's decimated, which isn't too hard if you match the enemy A.I., and start razing their systems, because of how the game is coded they will refuse to surrender to you like any remotely reasonable A.I. should. Designing your own civ is mostly pointless as well, since most of the choices will have the same outcome, regardless if you picked a xenophobe based empire or a faction that is geared more towards welcome other aliens.

You have the choice from befriending and building strong Federations over to dominating and slaving other species to strait up whiping them out you can do pretty much all you want in this galaxy. While you do all that there are special hidden events that can uncover and trigger, but I ain't telling ya. Enough of the Power struggle alone? Why not play with Friends in a Multiplayer that has no normal limit on Player numbers. In addition, if a friend has some of the DLCs make him Host and you get all of them for that Session too! Getting some of the DLCs is really recommended as they really make the game what it is. (I recommend looking up Aspec on YouTube and his DLC lists) I especially love this game as I am a big fan of the Star Wars Empire at War game, even tho that game is really great in regards of building your empire and fighting epic battles the endgame just gets laggy and the scale too big for the game. This is where Stellaris jumps in for me, as you fight grand galactic spanning wars and can build gigantic Civilizations with crazy technologies. If all that is not enough for you: - The Devs are active developing this game, supporting it with smaller and bigger patches in addition with big paid content drops. - It has Steam Workshop Support with a big and active modding community. - You can play on older Versions to experience them or play outdated mods - There are Discord Servers that host large only Player competitive or RP games - There are lots of Achievements to collect (Whit which you can flex as nobody plays for them bc everyone is modding) Negatives would be that the Game speed and performance drops in the late game, it got a lot better with the newest patch, but it is a problem that should be noted. In addition, the Multiplayer has the paradox Typical Out-Of-Sync problems, that can happen to you (Also got better with 3.0). And you sadly only can gain Achievements in a special mode that Auto saves for you, can't be modded and is not possible in Multiplayer. Have fun and go forth conquer!

There's some gripes I have with the gameplay like how there can be some times where you're not doing anything because you're waiting for population to grow on your planet, or how you have to micromanage almost every single thing, but that's kinda what you're signing up for with 4X games, so I don't really care? My main issue comes with the dlc structure. It's almost impossible to introduce anyone to this game. The 'full' game and all the dlc comes out to around 250 dollars USD, which blows. Paradox has always had a ""set it and forget"" style of dlc and pricing, and it's nowhere are prevalent as Stellaris. For instance, the playstyle most appropriate for newer players(machine intelligence) is locked behind the synthetic dawn story dlc. It cuts down on a lot of micromanaging and elaborate currencies(like internal factions, trade value, and consumer goods) such that newer players can do a full playthrough without getting mindflooded by 6 more layers of currency conversion and balance. I think that Stellaris is an amazing game with an insane amount of depth and creative potential for the player that's bogged way down by an almost impassable wall of a pricing scheme. Absolutely pick the game up for the empire creation screen alone and the tons of flavor modding can add, but know what you're getting into in terms of dlc. All the dlc goes on sale about as often as new dlcs are released, but thats still gonna set you back ~100 bucks. The main game goes on sale often.

Basically, you are forced to buy the DLC or the games become less and less playable. And look at the cost to get all the critical DLC, and it soon adds up to a fortune. A small amount of paid DLC is fine, or lots of low cost DLC would be fine. Not this. As a result, perhaps excepting HoI, I think I am done with Paradox.

392,skeletoastofundead,https://steamcommunity.com/id/skeletoastofundead/,"This game is an amazing game, in its core aspects and gameplay mechanics. However, even if a game can be so amazing, it has many many flaws.. First off, its price: It is way too overpriced and I would in no way recommend to buy it, let alone its DLCs, without a good sale going to decrease the price significantly in order to save as much money as possible. Second off, the content you get for the game's price without any DLCs is quite underwhelming, sure there is a whole lot of things to do but after a good century or so of a game, it just runs out of interesting stuff and turns into a boring and repetitive experience. Third off, the content you get for the game's DLCs is worth it for the price, I just wouldn't recommend buying too many without a sale, but I do know that DLCs enhance the game experience a lot more and add things that can change the way of the game and potentially even change the way you see it. An Overall Conclusion: The game IS a fun game, you can play for countless of hours without getting bored but eventually you WILL get bored without DLCs, yet waiting for a sale on the DLCs is going to take time and by the time that happens, you might as well just buy something else. If you do catch this game on a sale however, you should no doubt buy as much as you can for it, as the game is extremely good in both mechanics and the general idea of the game.

It takes a lot of time, but in between wars or time-restricted event chains you have the time to just chat with each other over Discord.

The only thing that somewhat irks me is the amount of ways the game can be min-maxed and cheesed. It is fine when you play on your own, as you are either the one doing it or you can fully ignore it. But when you play with your friends, suddenly they have 400 population, even with the new system while you are hanging around at 80 because there was a mechanic somewhere that wasn´t really explained. This game needs a tutorial of some sorts at this point. I play since the beginning (still being a scrub but that is ok) and without being introduced into the hundreds of mechanics one by one I would have been overwhelmed. Addition: I don´t get the hate about the new pop system. But I am not an optimizer in my gameplay, so maybe it´s just something other people care about.

433,scradam78,https://steamcommunity.com/id/scradam78/,"They offered a pretty good deal on Humble Bundle for the base game and many expansions a few weeks ago, in March 2021.  They sold literally 160k copies of the game in two weeks with a revenue of $1.6 million.  Those figures are pretty good for a game that was released 5 years ago.  The Humble sale was really good, but the sale only seemed 'once in a lifetime' when you consider the outlandish price tags on Paradox DLC otherwise. Whether Paradox meant to or not, I bet they created a g*** market for this game with their last Humble sale vs regular Steam pricing, and they have probably gotten several to many new users into the g*** market that wouldn't go there otherwise.  There are probably a few nefarious websites out there that are very grateful for Paradox pricing and sales strategy, at the detriment to everyone else, including Valve, Humble Bundle, and the consumers. I might be less critical if they didn't blow up the save game that I spent ~150 hours on when the update dropped.  It's okay though; I was getting really bored with the game.  As others have said, a single player game gets really tedious before you even bother to finish it.  I should probably be grateful the update convinced me to move onto something else.

526,philosophizing,https://steamcommunity.com/id/philosophizing/,"Product received for free 𝐇𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐨 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲𝐨𝐧𝐞! The team «Paradox Interactive» has released another game in which we can again be the leader of the people. But how is this game different from the rest? This is freedom. You see, in most games from the studio «Paradox Interactive», everything is invented for you. For instance «Europa Universalis IV» that already has templates. I am not saying that this is bad. There are simply times when you want to create something of your own. Come up with an individual coat of arms, think over your own story, and so on. And now, the game came out «Stellaris», where such an opportunity arises. At the same time, the game throws, from our home planet, into space. As I said above, here you can create your own state. And you don't have to take the human race. There are many different races here, ranging from mammals to necroids (latest addition). And in each race there are many portraits. Yes, here you will not be able to create your own spaceship design or draw an individual race, but write down their advantages, disadvantages, preferred world, their beginning, and so on. Yes, you can start the game during a successful unification on the planet or after a nuclear war. In doing so, you will have certain pros and cons. Who can you be? You can be a pacifist who studies the galaxy for scientific discovery. Or choose a race of robots and destroy all life in the galaxy. Or maybe you teach to be a state, capable of making anyone subjugate and demanding tribute from him? Yes, you can be a fanatic who will declare war on another state in order to simply impose your ideology ... or destroy. I think I briefly talked about the game. We will now look at all aspects. I liked the game, but the pros and cons are also worth talking about: • 𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬: — Well-designed world. Here you will see not only alternative empires, but various anomalies, dead states, giant space monsters and much more. — As I said earlier, here you can become anyone you want. Starting from a militarist and ending with a pacifist. — Nice graphics. First of all, I was attracted by beautiful space backgrounds, bright stars and various effects. Will pull even on a weak computer (if it is really weak, then I would not recommend using a galaxy with 1100 stars). — Sophisticated sound effects. Beautiful graphics with beautiful soundtrack will immerse you in this game. I advise you to listen to music separately. You will be delighted. — Optimized. I think you already figured it out. • 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬: — Errors during gameplay. Although they are few, they can ruin your game. For example, a mysterious fortress in space. If an attempt to enter is unsuccessful, errors will begin, ranging from pop-up dialogs and ending with unsuccessful attempts to enter (you, due to pop-up dialogs, simply cannot even fly up to her). — Lots of paid add-ons. As long as I know these developers, they don't change. By purchasing the game itself, you get 35% of all the possibilities that will make you just give up the game. But by purchasing all the add-ons, you get everything from creating megastructures to new races. — High price. Some add-ons are worth the money. But there are those for which I would not give money. 𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐩𝐮𝐭: The game is simply beautiful and perfect, if you do not pay attention to its shortcomings. But again, if you want to enjoy the game, then buy almost all add-ons.

The narrative elements are definitely the game's strong suit - cybernetically augmenting your population, uplifiting primitive species, building ludicrous superstructures, committing a wide array of crimes against both humanity and alienity.  The empire creator is also very entertaining. Overall, Stellaris is more of a sandbox emergent narrative engine than a tightly balanced strategic puzzle - personally, I find this style of design very appealing. The game isn't without its problems - the AI is incredibly stupid (to the point where annexing planets will often tank your economy with how mismanaged they are), performance in the later stages of the game gets really poor, and the micromanagement turns from addictive to annoying as your empire grows.

Also I had to modify some of the meta data. However having done this I've enjoyed playing. The manufacturers should sort these issue out so you as a player don't waste hours trying to solve the issues. An official step by step installation guide should be available. For some folks who have been playing long term from the forums this is not an issue. As a newbie it was. I only persevered as Steam refused to refund me as |I'd been playing the game for over 24 hours.

Economic management is also essential in order to not go into a severe resource deficit.

This is like the Civilization series but without the turn-based mechanic. Did I mention policies? As a galactic empire you can also enact certain edicts that heavily influences your economy or military. And you can even form federations with other AI empires to take down bigger, stronger ones or to go after the fallen empires.

The beginning of the game however can be a bit slow to get started, but at the beginning is where you do the most micromanagement in the game as some tech isn't unlocked yet. Meeting the other empires the game offer is fine, BUT I have more entertainment in making my own empires and meeting them , it's fun to see how they interact with my empire and with each other, although most of the time they hate each other or block off their boarders 50% of the time. Nonetheless surviving in the game isn't easy, but once you understand the economics of the game it should be smooth sailing! Now my own personal preference is this: get mods! This game by itself is good BUT the mods make the game more entertaining as the wonderful community is very creative and fun with their ideas I would sit here to talk about them all but it would take too long BUT I can list a few I have used here are the following Machine Shipset Tiny Outliner v2 Planetary Diversity Stellar-Naval Ship Art Pack just to name a few, now I hope the new comers who see the reviews take the chance to buy and play this game and have a blast with it, I highly recommended this game to others",Recommended,1084.0,"8,670.7 hrs on record",Posted: 22 February

I avoided RTS games like the plague for the longest time. Being an avid fan of fighting games, action adventure, and pretty much any game where you have direct control over combat, these games just seemed super complicated and a bit boring. It took me forever to give turn based action games a try like Final Fantasy 7 and Persona 5 and I ended up loving those games to death. I made the exception for Stellaris because if it’s pretty visuals and my love for Sci-Fi so this game might just be an outlier as if this was one of the Civilization  games, say that takes place in Rome. I feel like I may not be as infatuated with this game as I am. Now that’s not saying this games mechanics aren’t good but it’s amazing. Only uplifted even higher by its setting. This game is insane and the level of quality here is mind blowing. Creating your own human or alien society, giving them a backstory, all of the awesome side quests with amazing writing, the politics and combat is so much fun.

551,SkiRich,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SkiRich/,"Version 3.0.3 Review: As promised I would alter my review and recommendation if the developers fixed and listened to the player base concerning their changes in 3.0.0 They did and to everyone's surprise they instituted a change that people were demanding. Sliders to control the new pop mechanic that was a big fat nerf to the game in 3.0.0.  That nerf caused many gameplay styles to become unplayable. 3.0.3 was created and gave back this control to the player. A wonderful and thoughtful patch. Thank you developers! --------------------------------------- The below is for Version 2.8 --------------------------------------- What is there to say that hasen't been said before in another review? You dont want to read that from me? Here is how I felt about the game: If you combine elements of the original Star Trek Series, add in some Episode 4 Star Wars, and sprinkle it with a little Expanse (the series), this is what you get. Its a fantastic game in the true sense of Epic Grand Strategy. There is a little for everyone, from politics and federations, to the Galactic Senate from Star Wars, to 4x grind your enemy down with cool lasers. Its a tough steep learning curve to play right, but that doesnt mean its not fun when you start out. You will have an early advantage if you liked playing Crusader Kings 2/3 and Civilization 5/6,  the concepts of 4x Grand Strategy mixed with realtime, not turned based dynamics is really special. The game is quite mature so you really need to weed out all the stale youtube videos that dont apply anymore, or take things you watch and then try and apply them. Read, alot.  Lots of forums, wikis and reddits with tons of info.  Dont go nuts trying to watch a lets play video on this, unless its 10 minutes or less.  You cant cover this game and be quick, so all the videos that try, well their probably missing something.  Find the shorties about a specific mechanic and then try it. The game has been around since 2016 and its grown quite a bit in content and complexity. It took me 4 aborted games, 2 half games, and one long play before I finally got to the point I knew most of the mechanics of the game. I'm on my 8th game now and its been going for two weeks straight daily to get to 3/4 of the way through the game. Epic for sure. And you never stop learning because the AI is always throwing something new at you.  With a mature game like this, you have plenty of help online in the forums if you have questions.  Nice folks there too, wiling to help. I play overnight since I work durinig the day.  If I had to wait 5 minutes before I got a reply at 3AM that wass long. Daily, the steamdb counters say overnight there are 15,000+ players running the game.  Its a 5 year old game and that many still play daily?  That tells you something. Yep, I'm hooked.  This is the game I can see playiig for the next 6 months easy. As for content ... The base game is nice, and complete, but you really really want to get the game changing DLC's like Federations and Relics. I cant see playing this game without them now. Juts buy it all, even if you need to wait for a sale. Worth every penny.  I can see myself putting in at least 1000 hours of playtime on this for sure.",Recommended,2611.0,"1,461.6 hrs on record",Posted: 20 February

Bad treatment of DLC. Overall fun if you like stuff like Sid's Civilization and CK3. (Also easier to get into than CK3). Although of course the game has a decent bit of problems I have with it, not all with the base game itself, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games of building power against other entities. It's fun if you like the genre, but I wouldn't blame you if it wasn't your cup of tea. The game can be made to be as ""power-trip"" or ""unbelievable challenge"" as you want to make it in the settings when you set up your game. You get immense amounts of options to choose from creating both the world and your empire, which is always a big bonus.  You wanna make a genocidal robot uprising with your buddies? Or a peace loving hive mind? Maybe you want to recreate one of your favorite science fiction empires? All 100% doable. Granted, if you wanted to recreate the Covenant from Halo, you may need a mod or two, but that's pretty well handled as well, and though the modding scene isn't as lively as it once was, a lotta stuff still works and is out there for you. There's something for the controlling and the ones who just wanna raze or raise a galaxy-wide empire.  You can go simple and put things to automatically determine what's the best, or you can fully dive in and control everything yourself. This game is absolutely stellar, but after you get used to how to play, I fully recommend playing with others rather than on your own. Only because, honestly I find it so much more fun that way. One of the only issues I have with this game, and moreso just how it's handled, is that there's a lot of DLC released with much higher a price tag than is reasonable, as can be seen in the reviews of them.

BEST space strategy game by a LONG shot, and I'll go so far as to say best strategy game overall as well.

This game is more different today than it was at launch than other space strategy games are from game 1 and 2.  ALL of those patches and updates are free...  Soooo lack of content?  Are these people insane?  Now one part that I WILL point out, commonly Paradox puts out a massive patch with their expansions and gives away a ton of the content for free.  And then they only paywall a small portion.  Now if ALL you were looking at is what is behind the paywall, it may not add too much.  But if you look at the entire rest of the update that they GAVE AWAY FOR FREE, then the expansions add a ton. With that part in mind, if you're NEW to this game, you might want to wait for a steam sale.  The expansions commonly will be dirt cheap and a great time to pick things up.  I look at the expansions honestly as a way for me to say thanks to Paradox for a game that I've legitimately sunk thousands of hours into.

Stellaris is a 4X Grand Strategy game, so right off the bat you should expect to do some exploring, expanding, exploiting and exterminating. It's also gone through so many patches, updates, hotfixes and miscellaneous changes that Stellaris in 2021 is vastly different from Stellaris in 2016. There have been mixed responses to those changes, but it's really not as bad as some people will make it sound. Around the time the game was released, I didn't see the point of it. A bunch of my friends were playing it, but I was happy with Sins of a Solar Empire. I figured it was basically the same thing. I was wrong. I also struggled to get into the game at first, because my only prior experience with Grand Strategy was Crusader Kings 2, which I struggled to get into even more. But, unlike CK2, I kept trying with Stellaris, and eventually I got over the comparatively small initial learning curve and made my way up the rest of the learning curve. In short: don't be deterred, Stellaris is sufficiently easy to learn that it can serve as a gateway into the Grand Strategy genre of games. I've played a lot of Stellaris. 906.6 hours according to Steam, as of writing. Suffice it to say that I'm probably a little bit biased, because I've been returning to it every now and then for years. It's not a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a game with dedicated developers, fans and modders. In fact, as it happens, much of my playtime has been with mods installed, and while ensuring compatibility can be a pain when you have a hundred of the things active, it's a lot of fun.

594,infolder,https://steamcommunity.com/id/infolder/,"Once upon a time there was a video game called Stellaris. It was a remarkable 4X strategy about managing your own cilivization, exploring unknown space and dealing with various random events, threats from other sentient life (or not so sentient) and plenty of other things. In spite of other numerous space games, Stellaris managed to stand out among competitors. It got a lot of fans, and workshop made the game even better. I would even call Stellaris a piece of art at the time of its release. I spent a lot of wonderful hours playing the game back then. Unfortunately, that couldn't last forever. It all started when 2.0 update happened... I won't be retelling all pros and cons of that and next updates, it had already been stated in other reviews well enough. The point is that some smart guys from Paradox suddenly realised that Stellaris was too different from other Paradox's grand strategies, it was too unique. Therefore, there were mainly two options for further development of the game: To keep on creating new high-quality content , fix bugs, etc. To drastically change the game. To abolish some important old features, to introduce new ones meanwhile slowly turning Stellaris into a bleak copy of other Paradox's games like Hearts of Iron or Europa Universalis, so that they could easily make money selling lots of ""brand new"" DLC's. Other variants. Obviously, Paradox chose the second variant. They virtually turned Stellaris into their another DLC factory. Moreover, the perfomance got much worse and the I-don't-know-how-many-years-old bugs hadn't been fixed. Don't buy this game. Its time passed a long time ago. It had potential, but it was ruined by greedy Paradox. p.s. For all Paradox fanboys, who would say something like ""but there is so much content since 1.9 version, the game is constantly getting updates"": It doesn't matter how much content the game has if it's tedious as hell to play.

600,barexor,https://steamcommunity.com/id/barexor/,"After having played several campaigns with differing results over the course of 180 hours, I feel like I can write an honest review about my impressions of Stellaris. Importantly, I want to highlight what Stellaris is and what it isn't. At its core, Stellaris is a management game. That's probably obvious given the 4X label, but I want to emphasize how important management really is. You start off as a single star system with a single world (if you're like me, usually Earth), with the far-off goal of establishing some kind of galactic hegemony. Your first key to accomplishing this is exploring the space around you to find habitable worlds to expand to, as well as any neighboring space-faring civilizations. The latter part of this is very important, as your neighbors will largely dictate the pace of your early to mid-game; you might want to ramp up shipbuilding if you or your neighbors are xenophobic and militaristic, or else you might want to focus on colonization if you're on good terms with the aliens. I really love the exploration phase of the game, as there are a whole variety of interesting events, anomalies, and civilizations to discover in Stellaris. Somehow every start, with its randomized stellar neighborhoods, manages to keep things fresh. The number of interesting events to discover is so large that even after 180 hours there are still some that I haven't seen before. The timing of these things can also make a difference, as varying technology level and political situations can put a fresh spin on an event you've encountered in a different playthrough. These events persist throughout the game, but the initial sense of wonder in the exploration phase is really something special. Now, once you've discovered your bordering alien civilizations, you advance from the exploration phase to what I'll call the ""claiming"" phase. At this point in the game, since you know the local border situation, you are now encouraged to expand to valuable systems in order to incorporate their resources into your industrial machine before any potential rivals do. However, it is important to note that the very same resource you need for expansion (alloys), you also need to build up your fleet. So, there is an inverse correlation between your ability to expand and your ability to defend yourself (or conquer) in an early war. Now, you can of course increase production of alloys in an attempt to do one or both things better; but this may cut into your research or cause resource deficits, which are both massively important to take care of. Thus, there is a big decision to be made here. Do you expand quickly and risk pissing off neighboring civilizations while leaving few alloys for defense? Or do you focus on the fleet and perhaps miss out on some habitable worlds to settle? If you neglect expansion, you begin to limit your own ability to snowball into the mid and late-game; so often, if you can get away with it, claiming more systems is usually the correct choice strategically. But what if you find yourself sprung into a conflict that you were unprepared for? Well, that leads me into my biggest gripe with the game: war. Managing when you go to war is achieved through diplomacy. This is a fairly straightforward system, as governments with similar ethics will naturally tend to align with one another. There is a ""cheat"" mechanic to diplomacy in the form of envoys, which allow you to improve or harm relations manually. This can be useful for making a friend out of an otherwise powerful foe, or for declaring a rival to give your empire a bit of a boost to influence (the second resource required for expansion) at the cost of creating a guaranteed adversary. When rapidly expanding, making good use of the diplomacy system is absolutely vital for dissuading your neighbors from taking advantage. Improving relations, creating defensive pacts, and offering good trade deals are great ways to ensure you won't be all alone on the stellar battlefield. However, once you're at war, it's basically just one prolonged skill check like in an RPG. Either you have the fleet, or you don't. The way Stellaris handles fleet warfare is, in my opinion, pretty lazy. Most information that is relevant to the war is readily available: fleet and starbase strength are clearly displayed as numbers, and the diplomacy screen will even tell you the relative power of civilizations compared to yours. What this means is, if an empire with ""overwhelming"" fleet strength declares war on you, it's already a done deal. You're finished unless you have similarly powerful allies, but even then I often find their fleets are way out of position to do anything useful. There are ways to handle being on the losing side of a war, for sure. But they aren't very fun. It usually entails picking off isolated enemy starbases or fleets while their main deathball fleet chases after you or begins razing your systems. I've found there are some exploits to fleet AI which allows for an ""unexpected"" reversal in the course of the war, but I've been playing around with this for some time and it doesn't feel like it was intended in any regard. Defeat in detail can work, but since most ships just emergency FTL jump back to friendly territory when in danger, this process can be extremely tedious. At best you can buy time for your starbases to churn out enough ships to turn the tide, and at worst you're just delaying the inevitable. What makes fleet combat boring to me is the fact that a fleet with a higher number will nearly always defeat a fleet with a lower number. Contrast this with a game like EU4, where raw troop numbers don't tell the whole story: you have to take into account relative tech levels and morale before you can predict which army will win. I don't like Stellaris' simplified system. It cheapens the war, and essentially rests its outcome squarely on the initial conditions. There's hardly any room for clever maneuvering, primarily because the AI can clearly see that you're angling to engage them with a superior force and summarily retreats. I think if that information was not so clearly available, not only would fleet combat become more engaging, but perhaps a new ""intelligence"" mechanic could be added to the game so you could work to prevent engaging a hostile fleet which outclasses your own. In summary, Stellaris is a management game. Wars are skill checks. If you're not careful, the AI can initiate a skill check when you're not ready for it.

Style over substance. Yeah, audiovisually it's amazing, but gameplaywise? Not so much. You know, gameplay, the most important part of a game. Some of the essential features are missing. Starbases, for example. You can't influence their location in a star system. The game will choose the place for you, no matter how nonsensical it often is. Talk about strategy. Heck, you can't even influence the turret types for your starbases. Again, the game will choose for you. Yay, kinetic weapons in a pulsar system. And you can't do anything about it. Talk about strategy. Seriously, who designed such idiotic system? Games like Galactic Civilizations or Distant Worlds are far superior in this regard. Not to mention Aurora 4X, but that's a whole other league. I remember back then, when the game was released, we were also able to design our own science and construction ships. Now you can't anymore. Talk about strategy. And so on... Speaking of strategy, Paradox games (the modern ones) probably shouldn't even be called strategy games. There's just too much randomness involved (especially in Crusader Kings series). Also, good luck with roleplaying. The game will force you into submission with its (totally unnecessary) flavor texts and (often totally out of context) pictures, which will eventually destroy your immersion.

As a writer, I also like running campaigns in both this and CK3 to gain inspiration for short stories about robotic caretakers enlightening primitive civilizations to pamper and protect them and the ramifications of denying a newly ftl capable civilization their journey into the galaxy to preserve them from the imperialists and hive swarms that permeate this existence.

Stellaris attempts what no other game has successfully done; it boldly attempts to simulate galactic scale space politics over the span of around 6 or 7 hundred in game years with a degree of open ended-ness not easily found in RTS management games. The factions can be random or customized and there is an outstanding community of modders and players behind it. Whether or not it succeeds however at its ambitions is more dependent on your own opinion and which iteration of Stellaris you're referring to. I have tried and failed to get friends to play this game with me. To an outsider, stellaris is a very unwelcoming game to learn and its difficulty stems less from the enemies and more from the learning curve and inevitable mismanagement. I have found myself wanting to pick it up again only to become lost in the changes or disheartened at the discovery of my preferred mods no longer working properly. The strategies and exploits you teach yourself will seem to change overnight as the economy or politics are overhauled. All of the hard work and time invested by the modding community and players themselves is erased as each successive change upsets the coding or compatibility for ongoing campaigns or existing fan-made content. And if you're attached to the game already, this isn't an insurmountable issue. But for a consumer with no current investment in the game or premise? I can't recommend it in good conscience. What you see in the trailers or the advertisements isn't what you get and that's not because of something nefarious like exploitation or scamming, it's just the reality of a game that's changed SO much over the past five years. Until Stellaris finally settles down, if its not already in your library, I strongly caution anyone interested in purchasing it.

646,SolarHeartstrings,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SolarHeartstrings/,"So I've been playing the base game in single-player, and have had the pleasure of playing the DLC in multiplayer, so I feel confident to write a review here. Firstly, the negatives: There are still some crash issues when it comes to multiplayer, however it seems a lot better than in the past. The DLC, while shared in multiplayer, is incredibly expensive for what it offers. War can be mildly frustrating when you're aiming to take over the universe, why? You can spend 30 minutes flying your fleets around, taking over every planet that an entire federation owns, but because you declared you wanted one specific empire as a vassal, all that work goes away. You still have to do it, however, if you want the war to be ""Victorious"" because the war points are determined by the entire defending civilisations rather than the one you wanted to vassal. It can be quite infuriating. If one enemy fleet gets into your empire somehow, they can fly around and take over several of your systems, because your own army will be unable to catch up. If you don't have spare armies for a pincer attack you'll likely lose and recapture your entire civilisation every time you go to far, multiplied if you have vassals to defend. A lot of the DLC elements seem like they'd be amazing base game additions, and some such as robotic civilisations make you wonder why they weren't added at the start, again the prices are intense. The base game feels like it lacks many peaceful victory conditions, I have not discovered any as of yet however taking over systems seems to always come down to war, you can't seem to befriend someone into submission, though you can form federations. The positives: Stellaris is a fun game, whether your first time playing at normal speed to enjoy all the story elements and roleplay your favourite space fairing civilisation from Star Trek to Star Wars, to your own creations, or your hundredth game min-maxing all your elements to try and achieve the peak of your empire. Whenever you feel like you understand the game, something will go wrong, and you'll learn a valuable lesson. Stellaris is the game of menus, but unless things go horribly wrong you'll only really see 10% of them. Having to try to balance what empires you wish to befriend, which are threats and which aren't, is quite fun, though can get confusing when there's a lot of empires. The balancing of resources to ambition is well-handled, with influence points forcing you to expand to key locations, but alloys preventing you from taking over every system instantly. Multiplayer is a lot of fun, whether you're secretly stealing your other player's technologies or charging in with a 30k fleet to finally free them of the pirate fleets they spawned next to. Whether you wish to team up or destroy one another, it can be quite fun! The DLC is enjoyable. While it feels expensive and toys with you by having tiny elements such as Gather Information in the base game, the gameplay it adds is entertaining. Being able to play a giant robotic empire who suddenly decides to become the galaxy-ending scenario and starts to charge an undefeatable army throughout the system collapsing star systems into black holes as you go is an incredible rush after all the build-up it takes, and discovering an AI has a 100k fleet by a wormhole into your territory gives you a rush of adrenaline as your armies flee back in the vain hope of holding it off. The game has a great flow of power with DLC's, though can feel a little flat without them after you've experienced them. The DLC story elements can be awesome, such as discovering a planet locked in a time loop just before its destruction, or an ancient lovecraftian horror guarding a black hole, or an ancient civilisation just looking for a home and joining your people. This really helps give the game more replayability which the base game does lack in comparison. This game has elements for basically everyone, though many players don't play Ironman mode considering the achivement for victory is 5%.",Recommended,3327.0,259.8 hrs on record,Posted: 7 June

Stellaris gives you many options of how you'd like to achieve victory, this can vary from dominating the entire galaxy, unifying many other races together into a large faction of sorts, even just enslaving the galaxy's other races is a possible action to take to progress through this game. Another benefit to stellaris is I find they have a nice ""AI"" bot that talks to you, explaining how things work and teaching you things, he also alerts you of certain events that may occur as well, and this helped me at the beginning. For those whom are debating if they should buy this game: I think if you're very interested in any ""space"" stuff, like myself, you should give it a shot. Another thing to take into consideration is the beauty of this game, the systems look fantastic, lots of different colours and planets to see, different orbits and even black holes. The battles in space as well with laser cannons and all your pewpew power are very entertaining to watch, the pure Ecstasy of seeing another empires fleet is also a nice bonus. Combat: The combat all comes down to star ship fleets blasting each other and overwhelming armies invading planets (Did I mention you get to bomb the shi out of them first?). When it comes to invading other planets the combat is pretty basic but the ships are where this is very interesting: You can make a large fleet of multiple different types of ship designs. For example you can have certain ships in a fleet attack other fleets shields while your other ""artillery"" does heavy damage directly to the enemies with no shields up. Theres' tons of options of other fun little things you can do, but I'd rather not spoil all the fun here. After all this, Just try it out. Play it a bit. If you don't enjoy it you'll find out quick and it doesn't hurt to refund it. So what's the harm in giving it a shot? You may just enjoy the game a lot.

661,ChazzyIsToast,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ChazzyIsToast/,"THE WORM LOVES US. IT WILL ALWAYS LOVE US, AND THUS IT ALWAYS HAS. Stellaris is a complex, real-time grand strategy game set in space that sees you creating and customising your own race (or two), electing a form of government and altering your population's gene pool - for better or worse. Though I do consider the game complex, the slick presentation and UI work overtime to make things easy to understand for newer players. All major interactions are usually only a click away, and will appear at the top-left of the screen until you action them. The average playthrough begins with your civilisation discovering FTL drives and taking it's first steps into the great unknown, though they'll soon see themselves becoming an intergalactic superpower, with your guidance of course. The game excels in letting you play how you want. Feel like you want technological superiority over your neighbouring empires? Play as a research focused Materialist. Are you hungry for endless war and expansion? Play wide as a war mongering Militarist, or maybe even as a Fanatic Purifier intent on purging the galaxy of all life. Hoping for a quiet but honest living in a small corner of space? Build tall as a Pacifist. These alone are just the choices of government, which can be combined in a number of interesting ways through a large pool of species and government combinations, e.g. Xenophobic Pacifists, Militaristic Spiritualists, and Xenophile Authoritarians. If individualism isn't quite your thing, you can also choose to play as a Hive Mind or as a Machine Empire (Synthetic Dawn DLC required, but well worth it for killer robots). Your empire's style extends beyond their government and look. Each planet you own can be customised to your heart's content with districts and buildings. Create penal colonies to imprison ne'er-do-wells (or political dissidents and unruly slaves). Construct mining worlds and global alloy factories to help pump out more ships and space stations. Terraform resort worlds to raise your people's happiness and to increase immigration. Say to hell with the environment and invest in an ecumenopolis for all your housing and production needs. Top it all off with a Governor to manage each sector, who can specialise in fields such as improving resource output, cheapening build costs or reducing crime. You can also hire other Leaders such as Admirals and Generals, or specific Scientists to research technologies and man science ships to explore the galaxy, unearthing anomalies. Each Leader has their own trait or traits that provide bonuses or, in certain scenarios, debuffs. Being a 4X RTS, Stellaris has some pretty neat ship battles, and unless you're playing as a Pacifist Xenophile you're probably going to see a lot of them in your bid to conquer the stars. Although the battles themselves can end up as a passive affair other than selecting targets and giving the order to retreat, they're really fun to watch. Witnessing the clash of two enormous fleets is amazing. Chainguns tear through the lightly armoured hull of Corvettes, while a constant flashing of lasers begins to weaken the shields of Cruisers. Battleships launch nuke after nuke, battering their enemy counterparts. Strike craft pour from the hangars of colossal capital ships to defend as they charge up their takyon beams to unleash hell upon the enemy's strategic vessels. Losing a fleet isn't as simple as watching a number deplete, as this all happens in real-time. Did I mention all ship loadouts are customisable? Notice an enemy is heavily investing in shield tech, counter with lasers. Someone spamming strike craft, spam point defence right back at them, and a few nukes for good measure. Yep. If you're familiar with Paradox's Crusader Kings titles, you'll find that random events are also very much prevalent in Stellaris. While I'll try not to spoil too much in this review, Stellaris' random events vary greatly in their variety. Some events will net you some bonus research or resources, while others can completely alter your species based on the choices you make during the scenario. There are also many Crisis events, which threaten to end the entire galaxy in one way or another. These are some of the most exciting parts of the game for me, but I don't want to go into too much detail as they are best experienced blind. DLCs. Stellaris' many DLCs can seem quite daunting at first. If you're not looking to buy all of them, I'd definitely recommend you start by buying Utopia and Federations. Additional must-haves would be Synthetic Dawn (if you're looking to play as robots), Leviathans, and Ancient Relics. These are usually much cheaper on sale, so try to hold off until then - unless you're reading this during a sale! Note: if you're looking to play multiplayer with your friends, only the host needs to own the DLCs for players to make use of them (as far as I know). Looking ahead, Nemesis looks to be an exciting new DLC, expanding on inter-species relations, introducing subterfuge and spies, and allowing you to become the Crisis through an Ascension Perk and a series of decisions. If you're not too keen on buying any DLCs, most releases come with a free update anyway, so you don't completely miss out. Finally, continuing the trend of Paradox games having great mods, Stellaris has one of the most dedicated modding communities on Steam. To name a few examples: well written story mods, additional flavour content such as new races and ship types, and total overhauls such as Warhammer 40K, Star Wars and Halo, they have it all. Below are a few mods I would recommend after giving Vanilla a few solid runs to get the hang of things: Gigastructural Engineering & More (2.8) - Megastructures but turned up by an additional 1000%, this is a must-try Expanded Stellaris Traditions Expanded Stellaris Ascension Perks Guilli's Planet Modifiers and Features Real Space 3.7 Amazing Space Battles",Recommended,4935.0,391.5 hrs on record,Posted: 20 February

673,JohnSheppard92,https://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnSheppard92/,"First things first: At the time of writing this Review I have exactly 400 hours of playtime in stellaris and I have most but not all DLCs. Stellaris is a very unique scale 4X game with mostly interesting mechanics and I used to enjoy playing it very, very much. I had a lot of fun playing this game but as of late, I get more and more frustrated playing it, to the point where I just don't want to play it at all, just because I know I'm going to be pissed hours later. Just before writing this Review I started a new game with (for me) quite different settings. 600 Stars Galaxy, Normal AI with no starting bonuses, and Technology and Traditions cost with a 2.5x multiplier, basicly I wanted a long running Campaign, with time to actually fight the Galaxy and take over everything. I've played an assimilator machine swarm with a couple of smaller mods enabled. Nothing that really changes anything balance related too much. Game started just fine, I had 4 colonies that were coming along quite nice and was at the start of reseaching Destroyers which came up pretty early in this game (remember, very slow Technology). I had 2 fleets with 10 corvettes each and was at my - at that time very low - 20 fleet cap. Because I only had reseached about 7 or 8 technologies in each category, there wasn't much I could do about that. I found the first AI Player, he didn't like me obviously. Before my Destroyer Reseach was finished, that AI declared war on me and started moving troops. I did the same and had 2 freshly upgraded starports, one in each neighboring system to that AI. Both with about 550 strenght. First Enemy Fleet arrived with 20 Corvettes and 1.2k strenght. I was surprised by that, but had I put all my ships into one fleet, I would have probably had something comparable to that. About 2 minutes later on normal speed, I spotted 6 more fleets incoming from that same AI with strengths between 1.1k and 1.3k each and 18-20 corvettes each. So he had at least 7 fleets and about 140 corvettes at his disposal at that time. Thats about 7x my combined military strenght at fleet cap in the starting 2 hours of this game. There was absolutly nothing I could have possibly done against that kind of military power that early in the game. Sadly I've made that exact same experience multiple times now. This game sadly lost any sense of balance. It is just no fun playing against AI that cheats the ♥♥♥♥ out of you and could never ever sustain itself. This game takes time, and when you put in multiple hours to start a new game just to be utterly destroyed 10 minutes after you have found your first AI, where is the fun in that? I do know how to play this game and I don't even want to think about somebody playing it for the first time ever. This broken balance is sadly unexceptable for me and completly takes the joy out of this game. Games are there to enjoy playing, not to put hours into them just to get extremly frustated and burned by them every time you touch them. I will try it again in a few months. I won't buy any more DLCs until this mess is fixed though. If it gets fixed I will change this Review, because it hurts me to say bad things about one of my favorit games but if nothing changes this Review won't either. As of its current state I simply cannot recommend this game to anybody really, because there is a very high chance that it will burn and frustrate you. There are people out there who like that, but this Game isn't supposed to be like that and isn't targeted at those people.",Not Recommended,2858.0,426.0 hrs on record,Posted: 20 May

695,76561198035805119,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035805119/,"After 150 ingame hours I should write a review. So... TL;DR: Is it worth it? Answer: Yes! Stellaris - as all paradox games - has a low learning curve. Someone once said it takes 10h learning the game but 100 to master it! It doesn't mean playing won't be fun in the mean time. And if you're willing to spend time on a game like this your reward will be a deep, entertaining game, offering what other games wont. If you however want a ""simple"" 4X game, stick to Civ! It's similarities with real life characters and inventions gives a quicker understanding! Review I admit I did not always like the game and sure it isn't for everyone! So what to expect? Stellaris isn't an ordinary 4X. As someone who started with the very first Civ, I had a good idea about 4X games. But that's also why I hated this game at first. Don't make the mistake of assuming a Civ in Space (Especially not that Beyond Earth crap!). On paper they share mechanics - but they differ! Similarities (to Civ) City Building What cities are in Civ are star systems in Stellaris but expansion is more complex since only certain planet types can be colonized by your species - a reason for migration treaties with other species. Civ does not limit city development ending up with fully developed cities in the late game. Stellaris limits this, leading to planets focusing on aspects like using a desert planet for energy production. These limitations give a far more strategic gameplay in the end. We'll hear this more often! Expansion Civ players assume expansion is always great. More cities, more resources, domination!! Stellaris has different mechanics. Expanding ""borders"" is an expensive endeavour, costing ""influence"" - a resource that is used for many aspects like diplomacy. Advancing has a negative feedback making it harder to grow the bigger you get. That way interaction with other species is more beneficial. Politics / Diplomacy Earlier versions were lacking diplomacy but this changed within recent years. Unlike Civ (especially 5+) politics consists of a far broader set of actions than trade and war. The intercultural part is usually pretty simple offering alliances / war declarations. But Stellaris gives more mechanics. Ever dreamed of a ""Federation of Planets""? Becoming the evil ""Empire""? Having vassal states? Yes, some 4X games have that. But Stellaris doesn't end there! How many have migration treaties, slavery, citizenship status, rules for inter-species coupling? Yes, you can forbid that - you xenophobic monster! But know you'll miss what happens when your beloved space frogs fall in love with the fungus species next door! Enravish yourself, see what it offers to society! Stellaris' inner politics are astonishing, too! Beginning by selecting your society form: - Elected president? God beware of upcoming elections! - Perhaps a despotic emperor? Good life, quick... end? - Found a mega corp? - Why not a robotic-slave-collective (Borg-)mind after all? - Or perhaps the bee-sponge hive? If that's more your cup of tea! The list goes on and society has different political factions, revolutions, spiritual leaders and festivals, unemployment and migration, slavery, racism, civil unrest. Universal (alien) suffrage, AI-robot-revolts... I didn't even start! Yes, you can have it all forming your society. And it all changes the game - at least slightly. In short: It offers much more than Amenities in Civ! The down side is, management can become overwhelming. In Civ you usually have an idea on how a nation is behaving and what to expect. Here you have to learn it! Resources Resource management and trading is common to most 4x games and Stellaris has it, too. However this is no economy simulation and if you want one look else where! It also doesn't provide big economy chains like The Settlers. But the elements it has are nicely done, containing the usual resources like Currency (Energy), building material (Minerals), Food or aforementioned ""Influence"". The game wraps some economy around it. Selling too many minerals leads to dumping prices. Trade agreements help with lacking special resources... You can specialize your industry on producing them and they are also used for ship components. Lacking them requires other strategies. The game also has soft caps which aren't exactly resources. Like a fleet limit, populations, expansion etc. This gives a negative feedback for power gamers unlike Civ's happyness. Tech tree research: Science works slightly different. I hated it at first but it keeps things fresh: Unlike other games with tech trees, science isn't linear. Each time you finish a project your scientists get new ideas. Others get ""forgotten"" and won't be available soon again asking you to prioritize differently than Civ where it's just a matter of time to reach a state. Here there is no direct path to the ""best technology"". Research is divided into 3 categories: - Social - Physics - Engineering and you can research each individually influencing your play style. Espionage The 3.0 update adds espionage and it feels great. Where Civ reduced this over the latest instalments, Stellaris is improving it. Most of what you know about other civs depends on your intel. From anything beyond ""victory points"" to detailed info about population, fleet and technology. But espionage gives more than that. I'm not talking about countless actions available like stealing tech or causing a diplomatic prolapse. The real difference are the stories Stellaris uses to present the actions. Double agents, failed (and rescue) missions, diplomatic incidents... the player always gets more than just a window and a button. You have to read and make your decision. This is a big strength of the game! Music Let me quickly tell you about the marvelous soundtrack composed by A. Waldetoft and B. Meyer. It offers a partially orchestral score, other tracks remind on the work of Hans Zimmer (""Interstellar"") or Oldfield's ""Songs of Distant Earth"". Updates usually bring new tracks resulting in 6 hours OST at the time writing. ""Unique"" elements Stories I hope you like reading books since stories are a core element of Stellaris. It's an interactive space opera and lets you participate in it. There're countless stories from tiny 5 sentence statements to decades lasting arcs having consequences for the entire game. Discovering mysteries of ancient civilizations, archeological sites, background stories of alien races (perhaps even your own). First contacts with prehistoric cultures (will you observe them? or kidnap? Or even equip them with technology? Gigantic leviathans roaming through the galaxy bringing marvel everywhere are also among them. I even found an orphan space amoeba, fostering it, becoming my fleet's mascot. This narrative makes Stellaris really immersive and you should accept that in order to dive deeper into the roleplaying aspect of the game. Ship designer Unlike other X4 games your units (ships) are not predefined by the game. At the contrary, you can equip ships with your discovered weaponry as your strategy demands. Each giving a different play style. Updates The game is still updated regularily and it gets better every time. The devs listen to what players want! Every update brings free content and a DLC so you can enjoy it even without paying. Most DLCs are worth on discount but you surely can start the game without any and see if you wish to have more of it later on! Summary So in short (no space left for big reviews - there is a character limit!), you might like it if you find the time to learn the game. You should like to read space operas since this is what Stellaris is. Then you will enjoy it a lot. It's not a simple game but rewarding nontheless. My suggestion, buy it. Even some DLCs! The game is nice - especially in multiplayer!",Recommended,6504.0,323.8 hrs on record,Posted: 26 April

707,76561198244007724,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198244007724/,"Stellaris is a beautifully crafted game. the gameplay plays out as any other grand strategy, but the intreasting part is what you can do with it. you can play tall, having a tiny defensible piece of the galaxy, or play wide, a massive empire that spans a large amount of the galaxy. both have their pros and cons and can be exploited more with civics. civics are crutial to dictate what kind of playthrough your going for. if you choose a fanatic purifier, dont exspect to play tall, it is designed to play wide while inward perfection is better suited for playing tall and let world go to hell around you. the other aspects to cover is research, ascention perks, and tradtions. research is important to all empires, it is a way to progress and to help improve your empire as a whole. some empires are much better at researching  like materialists but other empires are less concerned with the speed of research and have a more focused path of research like fanatic purifiers/warlike empires. the warlike empires would focus more of better weapons, armoring, shields, and ship designs and only differ when nessisary or no more to research. the next aspect of stellaris is traditions and ascention perks. traditions are important, not because your lock out of certian ones but the ordering. all of them give different benefits but its not always useful at the time. an example of this would be supremacy. supremacy is not really important early game but can be vital later on. for early gane discovery and expansion. discovery allows you to scan planets much more faster and gives you a higher skill cap on your scientists. expansion gives you a head start on population prioritising colonizing planets and getting them ready to specialize right away, but its mostly up to personal preferance. ascention perks are powerful bonuses you can get by completing a tradition tree. you can get basic upgrades like more naval capacity to world crackers and mega structures. some of the most important however is the synthetic evolution, psionics, and genetic mastery. these 3 routes massively change the way you play the games and can also have an effect on the endgame crisis. synthetic evolotion is pointed more towards materialists, it turns your pop into robots, making them immortal and making them overall stronger. psionics are more spiritual focused. it turns your empire into a force to be rekoned with, it can give you high tier shields, jump drives, and it can give you powerful combat computers. it also gives access to psionically enhanced troopers but thats not all, it also gives benefits to all leaders, and access to the shroud. the shroud is a new communication which can give you free units from a powerful ground force, a strong ship, or benefits to your ships or empire. Its not all fun and games, there is a risk. the risk comes into rng a chance to get the boon promised or a deficit if it fails. genetic modification is a safe bet. it allows you to buff your biological pop, give lots of boosts to population speed, and gives access to clones. all of these can be used with most empires and gives the most versitile choise. the final thing i will cover is the end game crisis. the end game crisis can come in a few different forms. it can come into a interdimentional hive mind, a glitched fail safe set out on the galaxys extermination, ect. all of these end game crisies have their own strengths and weaknesses but all have the same goal. total galactic domination. they spawn with massive fleets and a desire to kill. you as the played must build a force to rival the end game crisis by federations or by personal might or perish.  in conclustion stellaris is one of my most favorite games i own. but  i think the price is too steep for what it offers and on top of that the dlcs are more of paywalls then anything else. they prevent you from experienceing the game for the most part, without atleast some of the dlcs the game is just a barren wasteland.

718,asto,https://steamcommunity.com/id/asto/,"I've been playing this game during the free weekend and I have to admit I enjoy it and will buy it. It has a very steep learning curve and is somehwat time consuming, so don't quit too early, if you like strategy games. I love especially the fact that you (most of the time) need reasons for declaring war. So a war almost never results in a total game over. It is nothing you have to be afraid of. All the features can be overwhelming. My first game was a disaster since I didn't understand planetary management and had a hard time building my empire. A few tips for other beginners: The first game should be without the wish to win ;) Just explore the game mechanics. Find out what works and what doesn't. Explore, explore, explore . Build a few exploration ships at the beginning and explore your surroundings. Enable the policy for closed borders on the first contact. This way I was able to block strategic nodes for other species and could fortify them. Afterward, I could expand without pressure inside this blocked/reserved area and had to secure only those choke points at the beginning. Build planetary buildings and districts wisely. Have a look at what resources they consume and build only if you have unemployed workers. Otherwise, your stability will suffer and your get fewer resources and they may start a revolution. When choosing tradition perks during the game, you may stick with one tree at a time. When you complete a category, you unlock a stronger perk you can pick. When starting a new game, you could lower the number of other species in the game. If you like achievements, don't be scared of the Ironman Mode . It sounds harder than it is. You cannot save the game manually, but wars and mistakes aren't that bad if you learn from them ;) Oh and most importantly: DISABLE the endgame crisis in your first games... if you want to play this as a ""normal"" strategy game without a frustrating plot twist (Otherwise look up what the endgame crisis is about in the web).

Whilst its fairly competent 4X game that will suck hours upon hours out of you, it's also still got a lot of issues all across the board,  sure Paradox has fixed some of the worst issues but balance issues still remain a big problem, especially against AI bots which have been overtuned so much, because of previous players complaining the AI players were too tame that being said... Stellaris is still an exceptional 4X game, but also still a spectacular buggy mess that unfortunately has so much micromanagement that it often ruins the fun of the game, sure you can automate 'some' of the monotonous aspects but would you really trust the AI to fine tune your precious resources?  Also not to mention some ridiculous end game crisis mechanics like AI rebellion that can literally make you go from #1 to last place in an instant if you are unlucky enough to get hit by it,   not to mention small empires running around with stupidly high strength fleets they shouldn't technically be able to afford or support. Modding support does drastically help with the major balance issues, but if you are an achievement hunter this is almost all mods disable achievements, and forces you to play in ironman mode which often punishes the player very harshly if you pick the wrong decisions during scripted events.",Not Recommended,1462.0,44.4 hrs on record,Posted: 20 March

Not anymore you can’t, you will have planets with little to no pops, which translates to resource shortage, which also hinders your growth. This should be an optional feature which I’m sure no one will use. I want to play it as I have before, paint the galaxy with my empire. Since I can no longer do that or even grow big enough, then this game is no longer worth my time.

There are fixes for this but it never stops it from breaking again which is does regularly and good luck hearing anything about when they are going to fix it over on the Paradox forums they either just point you to the post listing the tedious troubleshooting steps that you have already done a bunch or call you a troll and give you a warning.

The base game is very lacking in several important areas, much of the game is homogenized and plain.

Want to have organic spaceships? Not possible as far as I can tell. Want to have organic buildings? Not possible as far as I can tell. Want any species differences besides looks? Pay extra. I can't even play as a species that doesn't need ""food"", like rock people or energy beings. On top of these issues, I've recently come across problems with game design. I'll list the some of the most recent ones. * Enforcers, despite having a classic police badge, despite acting as police, count as military. Why does this matter? If a species on a planet is exempt from military, they cannot work as enforcers. I had a few planets stuck at high crime and low stability because someone at Paradox doesn't understand the difference between the 2 jobs. * UI doesn't scale. You can manually set a size multiplier in the game menu but all this does is zoom in on the low quality image files used for the menus, making everything somehow both blurry and jaggy. If you set the multiplier too high, the game in unusable and you must go to the config files to fix it. The UI does not adjust to the resolution of your display at all.

756,76561198825256141,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198825256141/,"Really tried to like this game, but in the end it does not work out for me. Just to make it clear: I did not have problems with performance, graphics or balance. The main complaint I have are multiple awkward mechanics that make you feel more playing a bord game than a 4X. I will not make an exhaustive list, nor select by importance, but just give some examples: you can design your ships (great, nothing special). But if you want to save the design you can't do it if any of that design is being build somewhere ?! No possibility to ""cancel any build in progress"". No ""use this after all current build order"". Either you wait for them to finish, or look for them manually and cancel. getting a system into your empire works by making a ""claim"" to it, then making a war. Then let's say you don't attack that system but you attack and occupy planets on other systems. Guess what happens at the end? (assuming the others ""surrender""). You get what you ""claimed"" and return everything else to them. Really?! It happened to me (kid you not) that an empire was FULLY occupied, but did not want to surrender. At some point your empire becomes ""tired"" of war and ends with a ""neutral piece"". What happens - you give them all the systems back. Just feels stupid. you have envoys that you send to other civilizations to influence them. But you have no way to recall them (or kill them or whatever) if you do not want them to continue. How is that a thing?! (yes, you can send them someplace else, but it's a rather contrived way plus, sometimes I really did not want them to do anything) anybody can decide to ""close border"" and you have no other way to pass through there except declaring war! You have no way to ""threat"" them to open border or sneak or anything. This can block quests which is annoying. research tree was boring at the end. Once you researched many different things, at some point you get stuck with a set of 5-6 options per branch, which is like +10% missile, +5% shields, +7% kinetic, etc.,  out of which 2-3 are presented each time to you to choose. This seems lazy and forced. there is no strategy in the research tree. You get 3-4 options and you have no idea what will be next, what requires what, etc. While I understand a full tree might not be ""realistic"" at least 2-3 levels in advance could have given you a chance to think about it. fighting is ""big blob"" against ""big blob"". You have no control over strategy/formation only about composition. It's quite hard to understand how did it work (mostly totals are presented like ""overall accuracy"" - yeah, sure but do I need to check visually what ships they had? how many? what weapons they used?) and many other smaller or larger things.... There are many things that seem someone put effort into (resources, buildings, populations), but does not feel consistent or enjoyable on the long term. Yes, I did play a lot, but towards the end was feeling less and less enjoying it because you realize how much you spend doing things that seem stupid.

I got 100's of hours in eu 4, vic 2, ck 2, and even a few dozen in imperator so it's safe to say that I kinda know these games. I love them all very much and they are a favorite for me. Stellaris however is not for me. Stellaris as a game is fine I guess. It really plays kinda like a civ game where every one except certain AI's start equally and all race to explore, expand, then inevitably exterminate exploiting everything they had so far. Awesome then, it's 4x right? Well yea but no because while it's loop is 4x the game is wrapped in the tedium of a paradox grand strategy game. You manage your planets and your charts while designing your ships and responding to events and blah blah blah. now that's my crack personally. running a nation and empire while it respond and shapes to my choices. So why am I not recommending it? Well because the game is really flat so those choices don't shape as much as you would like them to. It's kinda hard to explain without a example so spoilers ahead. There is a event chain called shrine of the old gods. Asteroid pops out of space and had some stuff carved into it. The text makes it feel forboding and ominous as you spend months (even years potentially) working through the chain and then you get to the end and... it ask what type of money you want? Yeah that's it. You want influence, unity, energy, or social bucks, take your pick and get lost. It's really disappointing and it's atheme in the event chains. There is very little that really happens because of them. Subterranian settlement on a planet? Well declare war and send over a engineer ship for a bit or make peace and let them be alone under the ground not really bothering you.  Sentient gas giant that has you move it's people around 6 times before starting a civil war and you take a side? nothing after saying we shall see. It's all just so meh and there's really no consequences for you actions, just money or no money if that. It also doesn't help that alot of these events will happen for every empire you make and will all play out in two or three ways regardless. The only thing that changes is the flavor text of you options and for some ethics you occasionally get a new way to say you dont want to engage with this content. There's other issues here too. Pop's are a pain to be micromanaged, fleet comp is all sorts of busted where what is good is just either all corvettes or all battleships with no middle ground, end game is a joke as the game really ends after 100 years and the content after that is stale, your leaders dont really have personality and just kinda exsist to give a buff. Just a whole lot of things that honestly make the game feel flat and has the least personality of any of the paradox games. With that said I do want to say theres some really good mods on here and it can be fun for one or two playthroughs blind. Vanilla is also the most playable of any paradox game. Also the first 100 years of most origins is significantly different and can be real fun. The last and most important thing is I really do believe the devs care a lot about this game. 3 major reworks in and several attempts to address community feedback make it real clear they do love the game. Still in the end (TL:DR) the game just isn't very fun and reactive for me.

I can't in good conscience recommend Stellaris in it's current state. The game is really fun, the mods and the modding community are amazing and add a huge amount to the game, most mechanics are engaging and immersive, you can ascend as a Psyker or become a Cyborg. The game is simply a lot of fun and if you enjoy Sci-Fi you will love this. BUT. and there is a but. This game is unplayable. Literally unplayable. The game has atrocious optimization and chugs if your save is older than 30 minutes, that's not an exaggeration by the way, the game will slow down and become agonizingly slow to the point where at the start of the game 1 Month in game= 10 seconds real life, By the end 1 Month in game= 1-2 Min real life. And there's no way to fix or stop this. Play on the smallest galaxy size with only 5 Ai's? Game slows down a bit later than normal. Turn down all your graphics to the minimum? Doesn't even effect it a little. The problem is NOT you, the problem is the game's engine and the way it utilizes your CPU. If you read the patch notes you will notice that for the past 2+ years Paradox have tried to fix this, it's never worked. If anything it's gotten worse. Ultimately the engine is too old and the game is inherently flawed and unfixable. This issue will more than likely never be resolved.

825,Phobophage,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Phobophage/,"After multiple expansions and updates, and plenty of hours trying this game out, I can definitively say this game is a conceptually fantastic cluster♥♥♥♥. There are a lot of good ideas in Stellaris to build from, and the modding community has to some extent done so, but a good, helpfully modding playerbase doesn't exhonorate the devs for shoddy development. Shoddy to the extent that it's hard to pinpoint an exact area of the game to critique, between settings that outright don't seem to change things (changing spawn locations to random rather than clusters has no noticeable change statistically in my game, for instance), to the constant patches that, while they do often add content, other times just change things for the sake of changging them, without any really discernable gameplay improvement (changing the system for pops and building tiles on planets, the newer system isn't bad by any stretch but it's such a pointless change that it seems to be made just to make a longer patch list to justify the somewhat pricey DLC, which is another issue in and of itself. The amount of changes being pumped out may indicate the game was released too early, but then that makes the price tags look even worse. It is also pretty heavily stacked against the less homogenized race options (Machine intelligence has a grand total of 1-2 ""Origin"" options, for example), so if you like to play something that isn't a normal run-of-mill flesh race, you don't get to have much variety there either, for some reason. Final complaint I can think of currently is simply that it's almost just up to RNG if you will get to play a full game or try to start 7 times until one works out without say, starting next to violent space racists who want war immediately, or next to a Marauder empire that immediately unites and spawns 20k power fleets while you haven't even been given the option to research a destroyer, much less HAVE any. Another solid example of this issue is the L-Gate mission chain, where the IS technically a positive possible outcome, but statistically, it's just going to be another 20k fleet spawning AI that serves no worthwhile benefit for the time and resources required to counter it, and bogs down the midgame to boot, Essentially, Stellaris leans FAR too hard into the ""what could go wrong"" side of space and not nearly enough into the ""what could be awesome"" side, and this does not change based on difficulty settings.",Not Recommended,2017.0,834.1 hrs on record,Posted: 10 April

It is an amazing sci-fi game with lots of story content related to sci-fi literature and entertainment. IMO you should go on space journey and admire the riches of galaxy, including celestial bodies, species, future tech and events. Enjoy the story, interactions and atmosphere. You can of course build a nice empire along the way, but the story and sci-fi theme is what amazed me the most. Enjoy your journey at your own pace which is best in single player. Multiplayer is where IMO some problems appears. The story is so rich that as a beginner you cannot absorb everything without boring more experience players to death. The next feature is a substantial number of details, stats and game mechanics. Most of them seems to have little or no impact on gameplay, so it is kind of game in finding vital info and rules in a sea of details. If you like going through tons of stats and indicators, pushing your memory to the limits, solving puzzle of finding what is important and what set of small bonuses to use, then this game will bring you a lot of joy. Personally, I do not, and I prefer game of forecasting, planning and adapting for changing situation based on simple but meaningful rules. But the sci-fi journey is still good. Unfortunately, the game does not give you proper freedom in choosing your strategy and pushes you to certain strategy or family of strategies. You want to expand fast, you have ships and resources, but it is impossible because you do not have enough influence points. You want to build great fleet and start age of conquest, but it is impossible because you do not have enough naval capacity points, and naval capacity is based on researching technologies, that are accessed in random way. After some time, you do not have long term strategy and you are focused on finding ways to fight these artificial constrains and responding to tons of interesting but rather insignificant events. I suppose it is a new wave of strategy games, aimed at keeping player busy by small quest, and selling yourself as a holder of the biggest number of features and custom solutions that gives you different experience … in finding the strategy the game wants you to use. At last, the negative and shameful thing. In game tips are misleading probably due to the lack of an update at some point. One context tip says naval capacity is related to population, but it is not.

Turns out, the auto-balance job AI isn't.  Isn't AI, isn't auto, and you can't just move workers around with a simple drag and drop.  I needed about 20 or 30 clicks on each population tab to fully get a sweet-spot for not starving, not revolting. No drag, no drop, just pain and suffering on try and fail. There are better games, with much nicer systems, go buy any play those.  I'm not going to spend one more SECOND trying to fight the micromanagement to figure out how much food and power this planet needs, and why they're not happy, and what the perfect job placement is..... when Endless Legend does that with ONE SINGLE CLICK.

Furthermore, they put arbitrary restrictions on what you are allowed to build on certain planets - some buildings are mutually exclusive to each other, meaning you can't build what you need as you need it - and you can't specialize planets for industry, agricultural, or electrical. This makes empire management physically impossible. Lastly, planets now have their own private resource pools, inaccessible to the rest of your country. Coupled with mutually exclusive factories, this has the side effect of a planet being unable to produce its own bare necessities of survival.

Establish space stations, fleets, colonies, and Megastructures throughout your region of space or foreign space if you can capture it.

The galaxy will not stand by idly as you powercreep your way to godhood. Ancient Empires will awaken, Enigmatic Creatures lie in wait, and other empires plot to destroy you and everything your empire stands for. The path to galactic domination (implicit or explicit) is often paved in blood and does not care about your humble intentions. Last long enough and your empire will have achieved galactic accomplishments to surpass the ancient civilizations and fought threats to the entire galaxy as a whole For Stellaris at it's core is a game about roleplaying as an empire as it takes its first step into the stars and beyond, guiding it to greatness or ruin, whatever that means to you. Without it, it legitmately is just a numbers game at its surface. Take some time to develop your empire, that should help you enjoy the game more. Of course it is a Paradox game so expect quite a lot of DLC but honestly Utopia, Leviathans, and Apocalypse are the only essential ones. Just wait for a sale.

Score: 9/10 Long version: Paradox is well known for their ""Grand Strategy"" games, including much-acclaimed titles such as Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis and Hearts of Iron. So when they decided to create a space-themed 4X game, I was reluctant at first, my reasons being two-fold. Firstly, Paradox has always produced high-quality history-based games, where they've put huge amounts of effort into researching the historical setting so that the game feels immersive. So a sci-fi game wouldn't fit that... Secondly, I'm personally not a fan of space 4X games. Nevertheless, Stellaris managed to impress me way more than I thought. There are a lot of systems which interact with each other, a tremendous amount of subtleties which you can (and maybe perhaps also should) take into account when developing your strategy. Finally, the whole game feels like a cohesive package, where everything just seems to work well together (and balanced, of course, as all things should be ^^). Graphics: 9/10 - the UI is nice and clean, the ship and system models are well done; I'd personally wish for a way to have ""themes"" available (not a huge fan of the green-ish tint). Sounds: 3/10 - I can basically play this completely muted; I'd wish for more ""announcer"" voices one can pick from Immersion: 10/10 - if you follow the story line, you're in for a treat DLC: 9/10 - I mean it's Paradox, but IMO they did a WAY better job here than with HOI Pros: + lots of flexibility + overwhelming potential for different strategies which result in a lot of replay-ability + good quality, the game feels as a solid product (should be after years of patches and DLCs) Cons: - I definitely feel the need for a ""2nd level"" tutorial which explains some of the more advanced strategies",Recommended,1514.0,43.2 hrs on record,Posted: 29 March

906,76561198869202237,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198869202237/,"I first want to start off by saying that I absolutely love this game. It is incredibly fun, deep, and easily replayable. After a point, it also starts to seem more like an rpg than anything else too because you become incredibly attached to your faction and I have found myself telling stories with the game, essentially turning my playthrough into a riveting space opera spanning hundreds of years. However, I would NOT RECOMMEND BUYING IT FULL PRICE. While the $40 price tag for the base game seems intriguing, in reality the full game is locked behind the DLCs. When you buy the base game, you are getting a pretty solid game, but what essentially feels more like a demo or early access version of a much greater, bigger, more expansive experience. The full experience isn't really accessible without purchasing at least of few of the DLCs, namely Utopia, Synthetic Dawn, and Ancient Relics being my personal recommendations. And the DLCs are incredibly expensive when you start to add them up. At this point, there are 5 ""Major"" DLCs, which contain more of the major content in the DLCs. Each pack comes with some pretty big additions, like mega structures in Utopia (ring worlds, dyson spheres, etc.) massive titan class cruisers and world killers in Apocalypse, you becoming the end game crisis in Nemesis, etc. However, they each costing $20 each, for a total of $100, and don't really contain that much outside of their main things. After this, there are 4 Story Packs, which essentially add new events and some new aspects to the galaxy, such as machine uprisings (Synthetic Dawn), leviathan space creatures (Leviathans), amongst other things. each of those packs cost $10, so another $40 total. And finally, their are the 4 species packs, which each add a ton of customization to species and faction building. I don't find these packs to be all that necessary, as they simply add customizability to the game, rather than affecting the gameplay itself. However, at the $8 a pop price tag, they do seem a tad egregious. So, in total, if you were to buy everything at normal price, you'd be spending over $200 total on this one game. if you take out the species packs, it's closer to $180, which is less, but still an insane amount. People should not have to spend this much just to get access to a game that should be much closer to $60, maybe even $70 at the most. So, I can really only reccomend this game to people if they can get it on sale. Anything above 35-40% off of the base game seems reasonable to me, and you should wait to buy the dlcs until you can get them for at least 50% off. If you are able to grab most of the important DLCs and the base game at a discount, you will still be paying more than the standard $60, but I feel its a lot easier to stomach and will let you play and enjoy the game itself without the guilt of having spent hundreds of dollars on a simple video game. And boy is the game fun. just trust me on this its great. I would write about how much I love it but I'm getting tired so just believe me.",Recommended,2489.0,182.8 hrs on record,Posted: 28 April

You have a larger ""power estimate"" and larger ships (so that you will lose that power estimate in a lower rate in a fight). You win. It is just a formality and playing hide and seek chasing fleets for years, that all their merit is a faster engine. The game is actually a stripped down, worse version of the ""Reach for the Stars"" game. Yeah, the one made in 1989 and ported for windows 21 years ago. Good GOD and they ask 40 euro for that?

Following on from that you have planetary management that will constantly need to be updated other than that the only real surprise is the ability to create your own ship designs but is limited and pretty boring. The graphics or looks are varied and you will spend most of your time looking at a flat 2d bit of space that is not good to look at and could have been much better in a 3d model, the battle graphics look great but the battles are over shortly and lack any type of formation planning just making it whoever has the largest fleet or best technology wins every time, each solar system looks cool with there own unique features and layouts with a wide range of planets and stars. There are many political options and alliance options in the game and can be very challenging to make the right decision at the right time as the stance of all the players is constantly changing.

Yes if you want all the DLC, it adds up, but you can see a lot of dev effort in here and it produces a hugely addictive, strategic and tactical game. Be prepared to play for a long time then suddenly lose in a hopeless situation! You can micro manage everything and watch every battle in close up if you want to, but a full run on a big map would then take a lifetime to complete! I compromise a little. I don't watch the battles, even though the artwork is lovely, unless it is a fight v a monster of some kind. I do not bother with ship design at all, multiplayer, or community mods, however I do manage every planet in every star system. Pause the game and go through planet at a time, it is worth it to get resources right, keep everyone happy, minimise crime etc. There are some oddities on the way. When you hire a new governor for a star sector, it closes out the planet you were on and you have to remember where that was to continue working through. All other leader hires work correctly and take you back to where you hired from to continue. The community helped me to merge fleets, as I am sure there is no UI for this and you need to know the keyboard short cut! (G) There is a lot to do if you manage all your fleets, including science, construction and army invasion, as well as the fighting fleets. You can micro manage star bases, factions, and a host of diplomacy. I agree with other reviewers that making claims and starting wars is not intuitive, but the sheer pleasure in tactically managing your expansion to grab large sections of the galaxy as yours, without even needing to colonise it all right away, (by putting star bases on key nodes early on), is awesome and feels like winning a game of galactic chess v dozens of AI opponents!!

This game is a fantastic 4X space exploration game with near infinite replayability...in theory when everything is working right. I have not played a single game that wasn't completely ruined by game breaking bugs. It is so disappointing to put so many hours into creating your interstellar civilization and expanding across the galaxy, only to have it destroyed by bugged event chains, bugged AI, and/or bugged game mechanics. Additionally, in order to unlock achievements, you have to play in ironman mode, meaning no save files and permadeath (permaextinction?) for your civ. That would be a great way of raising the stakes if the game worked properly. However, when you are 20 hours into your game and all you have to show for it is one bugged save file you can load to watch all of your progress disappear it doesn't seem worth the investment of time an money. If you wanted you could play non-ironman games, and hopefully be able to reload your save files when some game breaking bs happens, but should you really have to do that? Is it so much to ask that the game you payed for actually works? Here are a few of the bugs I have experienced in the last two games I have played: -Infinitely spawning hostile fleets after clearing their corresponding event chain -Invulnerable enemies -AI Empires joining multiple Federations -Joining a Federation and not being able to interact with it at all as enemy armadas destroy everything -Garbage AI in all respects in all circumstances. Consistently trash. I mean really, really bad. This game could be enjoyable, but I can't recommend it as it is now. I was excited to play it again after picking up a bunch of DLC on sale (the only way to buy DLC for this game BTW), but I quickly remembered why I put it down in the first place.

Then also the nemesis DLC acts like a story pack only adding a ship style and a new Ascension perk besides the new espionage system its... disappointing to say the least and i feel bad for anyone who was not able to play the game before this DLC and update. Paradox please reduce the price of Nemesis DLC to 10$ and reduce the population cap growth down from 0.5 per pop (entire empire) to 0.1 or 0.2, i know you did it to make the game less laggy but it also ruins a lot of play styles and forces people to play a way they don't want to as well as making people forced to buy your DLC if they don't want to have a skeleton of a system that you implemented to make the game more 'real/rp' but then notice that all they can do in ""gather information"" Now i'm not saying that the entire new update is trash its just the DLC and some of the features ruin the game also this is just an opinion and you can agree or disagree with my review ps. if you can revert your game before the update you will have more fun (IMO)  just make sure to disable the nemesis DLC if you have it, i don't know if this is possible but hopefully it is, and if they fix the game in the near future i will change the thumbs down to a thumbs up",Not Recommended,1468.0,321.9 hrs on record,Posted: 27 April

If you're a fan of grand strategy games like the Civilization series, then you'll absolutely love Stellaris.  The gameplay is deep and astonishingly well-balanced for how multifaceted it is.  Empire 'civics' and 'governing ethics' and race traits enable you to tailor your play experience to your preferred play style. The story is deep and varied enough to get a different experience every time you play for quite a while.  Game setup allows you to tweak the rules and settings for a custom experience each time.  Create custom races and even encounter your custom races in later playthroughs.  Late-game surprises will upend the galactic balance of power and leave you wondering if you're really on track to win the game after all. A typical playthrough goes relatively quickly, not feeling long and drawn-out like other similar strategy games. Now to talk about what's broken in this game: The AI.  The AI is nearly unable to play this game or even present a challenge for the player except at the highest difficulty settings.  This is not an exaggeration.  Currently - as of 3.0 - the AI will completely break down and leave their empires in a state of collapse before the mid-game.  Based on community discussions, it appears the AI has been broken for quite a long time - which is what is prompting me to leave a negative review.  The latest 3.0 update seems to have exacerbated the problem. Paradox seems intent upon releasing DLC instead of addressing this huge playability issue.

One builds his empire to the point where there is a chance of winning, the end game crisis occurs, a fallen empire rides to the rescue, then wipes out the rest of the galaxy, including the player.  Winning is possible if there are no fallen empires allowed. The game is incredibly detailed -- I found that to be it's charm, until it became unwieldy.  The micromanagement required is so profound, that it would require hundreds of hours to play a single game if one were to keep every aspect of one's empire dialed in optimally. I tried to like this game -- and, in some respects, I do.  But what I thought would be an upgrade to the great Master of Orion series is more a simulation than a game.

Still would try to avoid, but now that I've gotten through all the curve and figured out the not at all intuitive UI and gameplay, I do keep playing. I wouldn't have gotten it if I knew how irritating it would be to get here. This game has a sharp learning curve without a lot of instruction. You'll find yourself google searching to identify how half the mechanics work. There is an in-game browser that takes you to the game wiki for assistance on some topics, but really discord and reddit has the most information. Edit: The other thing I found myself googling a lot is where to click to access a feature that is hidden in plain sight. Bugs are frequent and you have to restart the game often to fix these. Enemy fleets that won't die, can't do something you should be able to do, etc. It was fun to guess whether something was going wrong because of a bug or because I didn't understand a mechanic. Edit: Automation becomes sort of an inconvenience and leads to a bunch of these bugs Its quite pretentious to make achieves only available in 'ironman mode' when the game is so buggy and the explanations for mechanics so sparse. Some mechanics work the way they do due to a lack of care: The Chosen One for example creates a god-like leader who is immortal, but if he loses an election the powers just vanish? Edit: The government change screen is not obviously placed and has no text implying on what to click btw You can make the species in your empire interbreed, but then you'll have so many sub-species that its impossible to manage. Warfare system weirdly complicated, requiring pre-claiming territory to conquer it. I guess they wanted to stagger growth, but it feels like clumsy way of achieving that. Edit: Yeah. I Still kind of wish I could take these halfbreeds and put them together to make something that's sort of a blah pop. Lots of DLCs that add more interesting mechanics that aren't adequately explained. They should honestly do a DLC to fix that and add more skins for races. Not to get too woke here, but I can make 200 types of white folk and then a few dozen types of brown folk. Women skins are totally neglected. Lots of room for flavor and fun, but it feels like everyone got tired and the game was just published. Edit: I am compelled by this game enough to keep complaining and wish for more. I might start playing other sandcastle space whatevers and see what they've done. Currently, suffering from sunk cost fallacy, took some time to learn the game mechanics and figure some things out. Will keep playing because I want this game to be good, not because it is. Edit: Yup. 5/10. 5 because all the concepts are amazing and the game is more than playable.

991,76561198226485564,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198226485564/,"TL:DR If you like Paradox games you need to get this one, if you like strategy and empire management in general you should really check out this game. It's a bit DLC heavy so if you're not certain about what to get just buy the base game, see if you like the core gameplay then go from there. I personally think Utopia and Synthetic Dawn are the must haves but I would look through each one and see what looks interesting to you. There's so many good things about this game I can go on for a whole essay. Not perfect by any means but the devs make a genuine effort to improve the game with free patches that come out alongside the DLCs This is the most streamlined and intuitive Paradox game and my personal favorite. Well designed and intuitive UI means you're not confused about which tab goes where or what mechanic does what. Compared to historical Paradox games you have much more freedom to direct your empire. You want to be a totalitarian dictator who systematically kills off any species that isn't you? Sure. You want to be accept anything with a pulse into your inclusive democracy and look after your citizens' every needs? Of course. That's not even the full extent of the possibilities for empire management, even in the base game. You're only limited by the ethics you choose for your empire before you start your game rather than historical accuracy. The sandbox nature of the game also makes each playthrough genuinely unique as you can set the galaxy to be completely randomized or set specific parameters to tailor your perfect match. Also unlike the other Paradox games and strategy games in general is that there's a great sense of development and growth. With the right technologies, some time, and enough resources, you can turn an untouched planet into an economic powerhouse. It's so satisfying to develop colonies and your empire in general which is a feeling a lot of similar games lack. If your empire gets too big for you to manage you can always automate development which lifts a lot of the burden and you can always reverse that decision when you want. This is also one of the few games where diplomacy actually has value if you seek it out. The AI is pretty decent so if you have a common enemy you can be reasonably certain that you can foster some sort of alliance with it and can count on it to at least tie up the enemy while you go off to conquer systems. I usually play on easier difficulties and I feel like there's a good balance of challenge. My last game I played there was always a threat to surpass at every stage, even when I was significantly stronger than when I started. It was one of the few times I genuinely had to strategize and prioritize development to overcome a rival. With the most recent update Early and mid game are now much better by being a bit faster, so now I play through games to the end much more often. End game has been a blast ever since Utopia but it's been hard to get to till now. Honestly I could keep going down every point but I'll finish with this: If you're looking for an intuitive and compelling strategy/resource management game that's also deep yet streamlined, this is the game for you. Bonus if you like Sci-fi.",Recommended,2615.0,487.5 hrs on record,Posted: 25 April

Colony blockers are bad, since I cannot build more buildings and I lack tech to clear blockers. My first colony could not do anything for many years after building its second building. I need to find research tech and spend several years to get tech that can remove blockers, so my first colony can build its 3rd building. So on a whole planet I could not build a 3rd building! It takes so long that an enemy attacked me in another system my starbase and crushed my whole fleet before I could build a 3rd building in my 1st colony. Colony cannot upgrade to admin office, which was due to 10 pops requirement which is not clear. The colony screen confusing since I don't understand what is upkeep and what is benefit. Does transform mean that I lose some resource? Districts are confusing. Is it like a building? Related to blockers in what way? I can build district, but not buildings due to blockers? Didn't know to build more science ships or where until very late. I finally found it at by clicking my first star system's star station and go to tab ""Shipyard"". Ships: didn't know where to build and when other ruler attacked, my starbase got slaughtered quickly along with my whole small fleet. I think I play on 2nd easiest difficulty level. Limited expansion points, so cannot expand empire. Suddenly hit limit and faced negative effects and difficult to know how to get more points. Did some harmony research, but was not enough. Strange 4X game where you expand is difficult. I had built starbases in every system I found, which might be bad? I think it should be positive that I get resources from many systems. Research tree not existing, so research options are random and cannot plan? Unity tree visible though, so why not a research tree? I tried 4 times to start the game next day, but it fails to start and it just freeze with a blank screen. My computer is extremely good so it should not be a problem, since I have i9-10900K CPU, GTX 3090 graphics card, 64 GB RAM, 1 GB NVMe PCI Express drive and 48 inch OLED screen. I found later solution on forums that I need to turn off full screen mode to be able to start the game. I lost the game, since enemy had much stronger fleet while I barely had none. My starbases barely did any damage to enemy fleet even if enemy fleet ""only"" had 50% more military score. I didn't manage to build a 3rd building on my first colony before it was game over.

1087,MaartenVanderCruyssen,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MaartenVanderCruyssen/,"✪☆☆ Mediocre Game Stellaris (2016), a 4X Empire Management Strategy Game set in Space / our Galaxy. I bought it for 1€ at Humble Bundle. For 1€ it's a good deal, but in my opinion this game is seriously flawed... Positives: + It's very addictive. You're going to want to keep playing. + The individual Star Systems look beautiful: the suns, planets, nebula, spaceships,... Great atmosphere. + There's a lot of things to manage. You're really going to want to strive for your Galactic Empire to thrive in all aspects. + There are tons of options when picking the characteristics of your Species and for the Galaxy you wish to play in. + This game is great to listen to your own music playlist in the background. + In Ironman mode the game forces you to think carefully about your decisions. It doesn't allow save-scumming. Negatives: - The Galaxy Map looks so plain and boring. And this is where you're going to spend most of your time. - The User Interface is a nightmare. It's not intuitive at all. I wish I could rearrange the entire thing. - The tutorials are a joke. You're going to have to find out most things on your own. - Contradictory there are so many possible characteristics for Species all Species just start feeling all the same. - There's no technology tree, or at least it's hidden, kind of. Choose from a number of random techs to progress. - When having unlocked all tech, traditions, ascension perks,... there's no purpose any more in research or unity. - Fleet management is more often than not a real pain to get to function properly. I asked for one ship #""!'%è§é"" - The AI of the other intelligent Species in the Galaxy is questionable to say the least. My silly federation ally... - Don't trust the AI to manage your colonies. It will run your economy into the ground. DIY or die. - The endgame is abysmal: These Extra-dimensional Invaders will waltz through your fleet and empire. - You only win the game by having the highest score at a certain time. - There are no cool Victory Conditions. No Technology, Unity, Trade, or Diplomatic Victory. Why not?",Not Recommended,1708.0,60.6 hrs on record,Posted: 26 March

It's unpredictable, there's lots of story events, lots to do, no two game experiences are going to be the same.

When the game is all but over in 2450 (thanks to an awakened empire facerolling the endgame crisis.... another hiccup of the almost too varied event system), and you're just fast forwarding as fast as you can to get to the end and finally finish a game, it's a bitter taste in the mouth.

Stellaris promises you a space civilization simulator, where you can explore the galaxy, get into the interstellar politics, choose your own path to lead your civilization. But in reality, it's just a clicker. The main purpouse of the game is having the biggest number of fleet power. Everything is settled around this – economy, diplomacy, technologies. You cannot focus on something else, as your civilization will quickly be destroyed by another civ with bigger number or one of few ""crisises"" (all of them can be described as ""many aggressive ships with big numbers spawn in the galaxy""). Diplomacy? AI won’t help you no matter how many defensive pacts you're in. Economy? You cannot buy any help in case of a war. Mercenary ""raiders"" are useless. Technology? Majority of them are ""Economy v.23: you produce 5% more energy"" and tons of technologies that make your fleet power number a little bit higher. There’re few interesting technologies that aren't ""+X% to Y"" and even those eventually lead to this. Like psionics are just an extra modifier to your leaders (but it's a different colour!), so they can be more effective in increasing your fleet number. This leads to every playthrough being exactly the same. Spiritualist corporation? Xenophile pacifists? Xenophobe isolationists? No matter – to survive you will have to play it like militaristic imperialists eventually. And then you'll probably lose, because the game has ""Fallen Empires"". They start the game as developed as a far-endgame civilization, so their fleet power is practically unbeatable until the very end of the game.

At least, not as far as I played. My policies don't affect the messages I receive or the goals I get or anything. I sort of like the species creator, because it lets you think about different types of aliens that you'd want to play or even write about, but the flexibility comes at the cost of my specific species meaning nothing but  a different profile pic flavor and some slight differences in how different resources progress and how fast certain things happen. It was really nice to explore the galaxy, honestly. I didn't totally hate the game and I think there are definitely some people who would really like it, but for me, if its a space game, I guess I just really need to play something like  Mass Effect where you get to explore the worlds proper and see e.g. fleshed out alien species with fleshed out alien characters within those species.

1146,forrestgump,https://steamcommunity.com/id/forrestgump/,"I currently have over 634 hours playing this game. While it has potential, developers have failed to improve the late game management nightmare. Solo play becomes a tedeious management headache. This results in much of the late game being ""played"" while paused so that you can manage fleets, pirate suppression, and planet development. I am not looking for more automation, I'm looking for a usable player interface. AND, I'm not looking for third-party add-ons that break with every update. This stuff should be in the game. FLEET MANAGEMENT IS TERRIBLE. You can't reinforce fleets that are being upgraded, repaired, or in combat. Fleets have to be in orbit (together) to merge them. I can't, for example, set a rally point and tell fleets to merge there. Ridiculous. If you try to reinforce a fleet that IS being upgraded, repaired, or in combat, you end up with do-nothing fleets sitting idle until you pause the game and manually organize/reinforce fleets. The Fleet management panel ends up with dozens of [0 Ship Fleets] that you must scroll through to get to the fleet you want. What aren't [0 Ship Fleets] automatically deleted, or at least have that as an option? SORT AND FILTER doesn't exist. I can't sort or filter fleets, planets, starbases, or technology by name, type, or sector. The Outliner as-is isn't sufficient. Can I search surveyed systems for planet types? Nope. Resources? Nope. Only by name. Wormholes and Gateways should at least show up in the Outliner. Can't search for those either except with the Mark-I eyeball. PLANET MANAGEMENT is bad. You don't get alerts for lack of jobs, housing, or unemployment, or crime until it becomes a crisis. Same for PIRACY. So, again, you have to pause the game often to go check what's going on. You CAN automate planet development and sector focus, but the AI it isn't intelligent enough to do a competent job.

I gave up on the game when I hit a weird bug that they isn't a fix for. When ever a bonus to percentage health is applied to assault troops there is a chance that the game will apply that bonus infinitely, this causes an integer overflow and immediately deletes all of your assault troops. Forever. You can build troops but they just immediately get deleted. That save file is irreparably tainted and you'll either need to roll back to a previous save (if you have one) or just start over.

Braindead at 4/6 difficulty. Didn't bother to try 5 or 6 -- became uninterested by the game. - COMBAT 0/10 : no tactics, no skills, no talents, no abilities, no positional value, no tension, no macro, no micro... just click and watch. Big disappointment. - ENDGAME 0/10 : congrats, you won the game by making a single type of combat ship : corvettes. you know, the type that you START WITH. - UI : 0/10. 1) Can't configure hotkeys. 2) You get so many notifications, so many popups, that it feels like a turn-based game. 3) UI is filled with tabs and icons and ""map filters"", you just can't make a game with more tabs/buttons on the main UI than this one 4) ""Situation Log"" makes you wanna leave the game after 1 hour - Resources : 5/10. Too many ? Also, food doesn't even affect growth and there is no such thing as production. The only thing you bother about resources is ""which one I trade with empire or market to get the other one"". - Construction : 3/10. 30%-50% of the buildings in this game are useless, including the ones you research. It takes forever to do anything at all on a new colony. Building something on a planet with 1 population takes the same amount of time as building it on a planet with 50 pops. Questionable design. There are so many other problems about this game. The ""crime"" mechanic is pointless, has no impact at all in the game -- at least at 4/6 difficulty. The factions are never a problem at all either at 4/6. Expansion is punished instead of encouraged. The Tradition Tree is garbage -- so many choices are meaningless, or underpowered, no matter what playstyle. Almost all the ""Decisions"" in the planetary view are pointless. Recruitment : one leader trait is equal to ""+10% research speed forever in every field"" while the other pick is ""100 credit recruitment cost instead of 200"". Are you serious ? 100 credit is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING versus 10% research speed 24/7. Despite all this, I recommend this game to people who like 4X genre and love to ""solve the puzzle of how to efficiently play the game"". It's just that, for me at least, after 30+ hours it goes downhill pretty fast, because all those numbers add up to nothing -- you swiftly destroy dumb AI within a couple of clicks after a good early-game phase, 100% of the time.

1221,76561198005406191,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005406191/,"Product received for free Greetings!  Today I’ll be reviewing “Stellaris” probably one of the more prominent RTS games of the generation and arguably the most popular of the sub-genre of 4x.  Now, it’s not secret this game is top of its class and known for the hundreds of hours of replayability so I won’t bury the lead here; the game is absolutely worth your time and even at full retail the cost.  But let me give you some of my thoughts as to why.  Let’s discuss. I was elected to Lead, not Read:  At the face this game is fairly typical for a 4x RTS game; you build stations, colonize planets and expand your empire.  What is impressive is the polish, the attention to detail and different approach to expansion.  At the core this game is more like looking at a spreadsheet instead of down the crosshairs and I found that to be a great change of pace.  And to be honest the great gameplay has left with moments of ‘why am I playing this’ then realizing I still played for another 2 hours.  There is also an amazing level of customization on this game starting at the very beginning of your selection of the faction.   Adding in the tremendous amount of modifications and DLC out there this game could keep you busy for years. Not the Civ Next Door:  This game is a bit of a departure of the typical RTS; there has been an upsurge on this style but this game does it a bit more subtly than others.  The game actually focuses away on combat and towards empire growth.  In the gaming world that is odd but from the perspective of a political / societal level it was actually refreshing to see something other than just bulldozing over every other faction and a bit of more focus on diplomacy and manipulation.  You can’t even attack other ships without a declaration of war which I found very odd in the beginning until I realized it was actually more realistic.  These aren’t factions with a thousand years of hatred for one another but just meeting each other for the first time.  This is shown more by the combat itself, it boils down to telling your ships to engage and letting them fight, it takes time to emergency warp and even a victory doesn’t eliminate the force just bloodies them up and forces them out of action for a long time.  Some might find this disappointing but I continue to be amazed how realistic the game depicts these things. Don’t make walls like that anymore:  To say this game has a learning curve is a bit of an understatement; it is more of a learning cliff, a wall, an impenetrable shell that not even the Trojans could get through.  Okay, I’m being a bit hyperbolic but the weakest part of this game for any player will probably just be learning how the game works.  I highly recommend ColorsFade Gaming Youtube channel for their amazing newbie guide, yes it is long; but so worth it.  The game has incredible spikes of knowledge, realization and overwhelming; all great things.  I’ll learn something new and spend hours implementing it only to find there is another layer under it that needs investigation.   Though I wish the game itself explained and expanded on many things more there community has been a great help.  I also feel the need to refocus on the fact that unlike most of the genre this game doesn’t focus on combat (even as a combat heavy faction it was still more managing your fleet than conquering with it) and this may cause some to not enjoy the game. Although this game will not replace my favorite 4x RTS (Sins of a Solar Empire) I still enjoyed my time playing and encourage any RTS Fan to give it a try.  I will openly admit it won’t be for everyone as the game has a larger focus on managing planets than building your fleets of peace sent to ‘recover’ a planet that was so rudely occupied before you could.

And we were only in the mid-game when we decided to give up. The ""tech tree"" is randomized which is completely frustrating if you ever want to go for a particular play-style. Early game you can get absolutely destroyed by random AI, whether that be raiders, or space amoebas, or shardlings, and they can completely prevent you from exploring and colonizing. I played a machine race, which from my limited experience I find very easy, as they require no food or consumer goods, however the ""pre-cursor"" race that I got, which is randomly generated mind you, was for psionic users. Being a machine race, it did jack all for me. Back to that random tech tree, I'd managed to scrounge up roughly 12k power fleets near the end of our 12 hours. I could only have two of them and that was me entire navy. Maybe I don't understand the system well enough, but I would argue back that the game did crap all to tutorialize it for me. The reason we decided to give up? It wasn't the fact that one of the other players had a robot uprising that began to terrorize the galaxy, nor was it the random Khanate that sprung up and destroyed another of the player's empires near outright. It was the fact that a fallen empire decided to revive itself out of nowhere and began to spam out 100k power fleets like it didn't even care, and, within 30 minutes on fast speed, had wiped out 3/4 of the players. It also didn't touch a single one of the AI, which really had me THINKIN' hard about the game. Overall, I wouldn't call it the worst game in the world. It's well polished at the very least, and has  near infinite replayability. Perhaps it just isn't for me, but I believe it has a few glaring flaws that need fixed.",Not Recommended,1455.0,37.2 hrs on record,Posted: 5 June

1253,76561198119437816,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119437816/,"Since I started playing this game, it has changed a lot, becoming a totally different game. I didn't fully support several of them (it still troubles me they removed the flavorful starting FTL type), but some of the changes were promising. However, lots of new problems were introduced: clunky management, job selection being very strange, extremely incompetent AI,... Additionally, this game has always had very problematic balancing, especially in combat. I stopped buying DLC since I was waiting for the game to be in a fun state again. After some years (for a whole year, this game had unplayable performance), and after going to version 3 recently, many issues remain or got worse, and some got ""solved"", but those solution introduced new problems. So, where did it all go wrong? Pops & Jobs: This has become a big mess. If possible, pops will always try to upgrade from farmer to researcher. So you have to limit the number of ""high tier job"" buildings on planets, which makes the managing of planets a real challenge. On top of that, with time, they introduced so many resources you need to keep on acceptable levels. And since pops auto-upgrade, you should really pay attention to what you do: if consumer goods are low, it's natural to get more consumer good jobs. But pops of that planet will auto-upgrade to that job (sometimes using more consumer goods themselves), and if they upgrade they will likely make another resource plumit. Another typical issue: a planet of mine was about to revolt because amenities were low. Strange, I thought. I looked at the planet: no one was doing amenity jobs, everyone was doing soldier jobs. Great. So I had to manually force people into amenity jobs. Combat: Land combat is extremely flavorless, but at least it's not a major annoyance like when I started. Space combat is extremely unbalanced. Several weapons are pure garbage, others are hit or miss (and if they hit, it's not even awesome) and some are so good you want to spam them. Early combat has no flavor. Ship type (corvette, cruiser,..) has little use: the game has so far I know always been ""the bigger the better"". They even made it worse when they decided ships could disengage from combat, as the larger ships have better chances to disengage. This has also lead to another thing: the bigger the weapon the better. Also, the more range the better. Most battles will always feel incredibly one-sided. Reinforcing fleets is also extremely weird, for example it only reinforces using the closest shipyard, even if a shipyard a few systems further has nothing to do. Reinforcing fleets may result in ships suiciding themselves, and usually also a lot of ""new fleets"" get made as for some reason the ships don't want to merge with their assigned fleet. Forgotten mechanics: some things have seen almost no revision, to the point it feels forgotten. There are still the same few traditions. The Ascension paths are all now questionable choices: the bio path needs you to sink a ton of technology, and if used properly, requires too much micro. Robots have clear disadvantages, and the associated path makes these even more prominent, plus, you also need to dump a lot of tech. The psionic path takes a lot of time and energy to maximize the rewards, and it is quite RNG heavy. The cherry of the cake here, the covenant, will also grant you many disadvantages. Nice. In short, the paths are additional burdens instead of rewards. The End Crisis has been years in a terrible shape, and now it's still like that. The awakened empires are much more (too much imo) of a challenge, which is sad. There is probably much more here, I don't own all the dlc, I believe that new empire types (hive,..) get poorly supported and have little extra flavor. AI: the basic AI on basic difficulty cannot play the game. It's that simple. They tend to fall apart due to revolts, tend to get shortage spirals (as said, resource management is clunky, and jobs make it worse). At 2375, you are somewhat ought to have a fleet that can deal with stuff, like for example, an awakened AI. 20K would be a good start. However, the AI is going to have something like 2K, while the awakened AI has fleets of 100K each. It's pathetic. I am obliged to use AI mods, and the one I'm using turns all AI into bloodthirsty monsters... I'll end it here. There is probably a lot more to mention.

I only own the base game so I can't say if the DLC improve it significantly but overall I would say that the gamemechanics are so restrictive that they couldn't save it. I don't recommend this game to people that like 4x Spacegames and look for something new or interesting for the following reasons: 1) Everything is game-ified. What I mean with that is that everything you could do in this game is very restricted. As an example, in the game Distant Worlds Universe I can declare whenever I want, bomb whoever want or conquer what I want. In Stellaris you need ""Influence"" a number that gets auto generated you need to use if you want to conquer something, and after a war you enter a mandatory peacetime. This is found in every single aspect of the game extremely limiting the options you as a player have to play around. 2) Shipcreation is limited. Not as much as in other games like Endless Space 2 but there are other 4x Space games that allow are far superior creation. But its not important in Stellaris because of the next two points. 3) Battles are blob fests. There are not tactics or anything involved in your battles or fleets. When you create a fleet its automatically a blob and acts like a blob. If you want to have make choices you are limited to a) the weapons you put on the ships b) which and how many ships are in a fleet. Beside that, while the ships looks nice, battles are fast, very confusing and so most of the time you only see some weapons effect while you watch the numbers of the fleets go down. 3b) Not only are Battles a blobfest but once it started you can't stop it. Let say you want to travel through enemy systems to hit him where he is weak. Your fleet automatically aims for either the center of the system or the next portal. In an enemy system they have at least a spacestation in the middle that enters combat from far away. 4) Travel by Hyperlanes. Before its big update Stellaris had unique ways to travel from System to System, but because that was to hard to balance they changed it that now all races only can use Hyperlanes. So if you play a game with few lanes its an easy to defend and vice versa, combined with the combat  its gets old real fast. 5) Nothing after the startgame. As soon as you arrive in the midgame, there isn't really anything new. Sure you unlock some more buildings and technologies but overall the enterity of the game stays the same just with different scales. It gets even worse in lategame when you need to manage lots of different planets and fleet while you wait to get enough influence to conquer a bit of the enemy territory, get mandatory peace, rinse and repeat until defeated.",Not Recommended,2233.0,137.9 hrs on record,Posted: 15 April

I liked Master of Orion's exploration, seeing the research tree, tactical combat, and the straight forward menus.  This has exploration and that's it.  Stellaris feels like economy micromanagement game. I've only played for 13 hours but this is what I really dislike about it. - There is no in game tutorial explaining the fundamentals.  It does have a function that tells you what it is that you clicked on.  It wasn't useful.  My online searches showed other people asking the same fundamental questions.  Where is my shipyard?  How do I get X resource? - Some events stop the game time.  Completing research does not.  There's some subtle voice(that I'm not sure is always there) and a beaker icon that pops up that goes away after a little time.  This is a slow game.  Me staring at the screen for hours straight isn't happening. - The User Interface is feels very disorganized or incomplete. - No tactical combat.  The battles just happen automatically in real-time.  To see them you must watch for them and zoom in. - The homeworld button showed me my homeworld system.  But it was so far out I couldn't find my homeworld.  It looked a moon but the gas giant covered it when viewed from a distance. - Empire boundaries.  I cannot enter space ""claimed"" by other civilizations.  Claimed space is not just the system that has a station in it.  It's a bubble around it.  It's nice seeing the ""claimed"" space.  Maybe it should upset the alien civilization but not physically being able to pass through it sucks.  I had ships I couldn't get home. I liked - The exploration.  The science vessel has to go to a system to find the resources that are there. - Maybe routes to systems.  Only 13 hours played.  I'll describe it as a street map instead of a space map.

Why not write a review while i mull this over. -Not Recommend. Why? There are no mods that seem to work with the game's current patch. I was excited before my purchase to explore what i thought was an extensive array of mods from the community. I downloaded ALOT of mods the other day, and only ONE of them seemed to work at all. Despite being released in 2016 there are somehow still bugs and performance issues. I watched my fleet of 300k power get picked apart without firing a single shot at a fleet of 30k power. And it happened again, and again. I watched a stupid trash fleet of 30k destroy my combined forces of 1M over 3 battles, i thought the collective conscious empire was using a special ability that i had to wait out. NOPE, just a bug. The game WILL start to get choppy later on when the galaxy is all taken up and the habitats are being filled. And, when i take large pieces of the galaxy over the game freezes for a couple minutes while it changes the borders, etc. The way this game is monetised is a bad joke. I bought the base game for 1/4 of it's normally listed price, not a bad sale, at 10(ish) bucks i feel like i got my money's worth (10 bucks for a few hours of fun with some potential for another play through). But, I would NEVER recommend buying the base game at it's regular listed price, not even to Hitler. (note to self: create race of Space Nazis before next play through) When i started playing my second game I quickly felt like it wasn't enough, I needed to buy an expansion so i could do MORE. I already felt like i had run out of stuff to explore, which was kinda sad given how much potential this game had, and how much time these folks have had to add to the game. The tech tree felt lacking, the ceiling was too low. There weren't enough anomalies, not enough events (i 'enjoyed' almost 100 years of peace in one game while waiting for something to happen, then we beat the unbidden in <10 minutes... Yay?.. Then i waited around another 100 years for NOTHING AT ALL TO HAPPEN while the game's performance got worse and worse due to an overcrowded map) So, did i cut my losses and walk away from stellaris having only spent 10 bucks? Nah, I'm a sucker. I hit the youtubes and checked out the reviews of stellaris's DLC. ""UTOPIA IS A MUST HAVE"" they said, well... it does improve the game. However, after another play through with utopia installed, i gotta say... it's not enough. I am once again left feeling like i NEED to buy more DLC just to enjoy the game. Why does this game still feel like an early access work in progress after i bought your most popular DLC? And, how in the hell do you justify selling that at 20 bucks? Now, here's where ya really pissed me off; Why does a fallen empire get access to technology that is behind a pay wall for me? I didnt buy the pack that gives me Juggernauts, or the Colossus, or the new mega structures i didnt even know about. SO, WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DOES THE FALLEN EMPIRE HAVE ALL THAT ♥♥♥♥?! Why do i get stuck playing with dinky cars while the fallen empires get all the big kid toys? All game long, there's this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wreckage left laying about after battles, there's debris which your scientists can study to learn about the technology your enemies was using... Until now apparently. Oh, you can study the dark matter shields, the thrusters, blah blah, but why should your scientists be able to back engineer the fallen empire's super weapons? No, no, that would be too hard for your scientists, at least until paradox tells them that the money has been delivered and the fun no longer needs to be held hostage. TLDR: I want to recommend this game, there's some fun stuff here, lots of customisation for example. But i can't, because of the way they chop the game into pieces and try to nickel and dime you. If you are interested in this game i would only recommend buying at LESS THAN half price. The same goes for the DLCs, Utopia is widely regarded as THE BEST of the DLCs and it's honestly VERY lacking for 20 bucks, if i could go back and unspend my money i would. If you wanna watch your life and money disappear down a hole just do it the old fashioned way with drugs.

Thus your focus is entirely strategic. Two large problems take away from what would be a great game. THE PROBLEMS: =Tutorial - the lack thereof. The ""tutorial"" is just tool tips. A number of important matters are outright not explained or are plain vague. =Ship Management - definitely an issue. Not intuitive layout for managing ships within a fleet, or non-fleeted ships. Issues of ""ghost"" ships within the management menus, especially with tech upgrades or when the ship design is removed from the Ship Design tab. THE GOOD: =Graphics can be run at max settings without stressing your GPU (on a nVidia RTX 2080 Super). =Random layout of home star system, galaxy, location within galaxy, and aliens with each new game. =Ability to customize galaxy layout parameters - which work hand in hand with difficulty settings. =Ability to customize your species and attributes, including a user written background story is a nice touch. =Easter Egg references to Starship Troopers, Star Trek, and others. Will I still play this game, sure. But it took several ""starter"" games, and guides just to figure out some of the basics. EDIT: Came across game breaking bug (version 3.0.3).

Tthe UI in general is a bit of a mess, but again there are mods. I had hopes for the modded version, but after a couple of games I was wondering why nothing really happened in the early game. It was a bit better using a custom race designed for rapid growth but still slow. It turns out that the population growth model in Stellaris is incredibly stupid. Growth is completely independent of existing population; it's a fixed amount per planet/habitat. It's like a two-horse town somewhere has just as much kids as New York per year. Apparently advanced players set up lots of non-viable colonies and habitats to act as baby factories and move the resulting population around, but I'm not interested in the game enough to work around the horrible design that way. It must either be a pride thing for whoever came up with the model, or they can't figure out how to balance a more realistic model like one would encounter in every other 4x, but it's a deal-breaker for me.",Not Recommended,1020.0,61.2 hrs on record,Posted: 23 March

They wanted to make a complex grand strategy game set in space but they forgot the part where it's supposed to be fun too. Then Amplitude responded a year later with Endless Space 2, basically saying ""No, dummies, this is how you do a sci-fi 4X game."" Stellaris bombards you with a million borderline meaningless mechanics and options. The ""hero"" units don't really do ♥♥♥♥ when they level up and there's a different type for each task. I don't mind micromanaging, but not when most of the stuff I have to look after does very little. Endless Space 2 has fewer mechanics and choices but each one of them feels much more meaningful. I also prefer turn-based 4X games over the pseudo ""real-time"" where you just play the game at triple speed waiting for something exciting to happen.

1415,76561198444739777,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198444739777/,"There are a few things I dislike about this game in the first few hours: 1. The tech - The research seems so random, you have little choice of what to research and I don't like it. 2. The battles - The battles themselves seem really dull. I know I am in the first few hours of the game but there is no strategy to play out during these battles. The ships seem just to go round and round. 3. Music - to be fair I have been playing Endless Space 2 which has an amazing soundtrack, but even then the music is boring. If you are looking for something with good soundtrack, get that instead. 4. Colonisation - Too much restrictions on what planet your guys can live on. Just live on any planet and build a bio-dome or something. If you can build something to withstand vacuum and breath in it then why don't you LIVE ON THE PLANET! You think playing a 4X empire management would have more places to manage. 5. Last point I hate the construction ship design for the United Nations (only race I've played). If I were designing a construction ship, I would do something way cooler than that. I suppose this game got so many good ratings because there was little competition.",Not Recommended,947.0,12.1 hrs on record,Posted: 27 February

When i looked at it in my recommended I was like ""hmmmm space Civ?"" and it is very similar. I looked up gameplay on youtube and was a little unconvinced that it would be easy for new people with 0 prior experience to understand the mechanics  and goals of the game, but was I wrong, when I tried my first game out it was like a dream, everything was so neatly laid out and information was incredibly easy to access, things I could and couldn't do were explained to me, and interaction with other empires was simple and unproblematic. Gameplay is incredibly addicting, The first day I played I nearly starved myself because I just couldn't put my mouse down. I was Gagging for new techs and ship upgrades top go fight my wars, protect my borders and gain standing in the galactic community. But whilst we was engaging in our little war for border expansion, a few threats were looming in front of our eyes and before we knew it galactic conflict ensued where we were now fighting for our very survival... The graphics are a little toned down as you mainly will be looking at the bigger picture, system to system, your planets and fleets, however you can zoom right in to your ships and see them in pretty great detail, but graphics have never really been an issue, the game runs smoothly and there is very very little frame drops. This is a great game where every time you play it feels unique and interesting, my only notes would be to add more dynamic end game content as without mods, the end game after 2400 (if playing standard) can get stale after you become the superpower of the galaxy, difficulty enhancers before the start of the game help.... but it's something that needs addressing in my opinion. Overall it's absolutely worth grabbing on sale, and getting all the content DLC's too, it's the best £30 i've spent on a game in a long time, and I can't wait to jump back in and play more.",Recommended,1640.0,161.4 hrs on record,Posted: 4 July

As world/economy sim it might have merit though the ruleset is too arbitrary.  If you like the idle clicker genre, and want one with fancy gfx and nice music, then it can serve. Seriously, beyond the visuals I see nothing enjoyable here. And the great potential makes you actively sour. At the start people could just fill the blanks with faith that the devs may fix and improve it post release. By now we see 5 years of that and no relevant improvements. Only lateral moves in ton of expensive DLC.  Veterans even say that every time ta new dlc hits the game picks up plenty problems for a long time. After a dozen of those the pattern is clear, you only get what you saw. Some other veterans say the game was okay before 2.0 -- that version is available as a beta branch. But it will not work with any current DLC and workshop.  The pop system with linear grow and seriving as limit to BUILD surface buildings just makes no sense and kills the strategy part for colonies.  The AI is completely both for automanage your stuff and as enemy.   What leaves you what, flying your science ships surveying and researching anomalies, if interested, reading some story-like text. I'm really sad to see this waste of talent and resources. If you're deciding whether to buy, read discussions and watch videos to know what you're getting into.

Not dumping a few hundred dollars into this game to see if that makes it more fun. Depth in game mechanics is a plus, but all the management options mean nothing when you are going to get owned before you can climb to equals with your neighbors.

Stellaris is pretentious and generic mess, full of promises about magnitude and greatness, yet very shallow in actual delivery. It has a lot of things going, but none of them is immersive as in other PDX games. There is no actual feel of other civilizations, most of stuff is more like a noise and pseudocontent.

As of writing there is roughly $200 worth of DLC out (some of it is cosmetic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that shouldn't be sold AT ALL for a $40 game) which incrementally adds little mechanisms to the game, ""fixes"" or expands an element and generally aren't substantial enough to warrant HALF THE COST OF THE BASE GAME.  The irony is, as much as Paradox thinks every new release of DLC fluff is going to compel someone like me to splurge on all that DLC all it does it make me consider buying the base game and just pirating the rest. I'm also aware you'll get plenty of corporate defending whinging about how ""if you can't afford it, don't buy it pauper"" but the reality is the business model is just exploitative and I can't in good conscious buy into it.  Plenty of AAA games release mountains of DLC (Warhammer: Total War comes to mind) which does it in ways that doesn't make me feel like the company is trying to squeeze blood from a stone, where each patch release adds content to the game instead of paywalling it. On the plus side; if you can dig around you can find plenty of mods which do more than the 20 friggin dollar expansions do.",Not Recommended,1089.0,93.4 hrs on record,Posted: 16 March

I gave it a shot and just couldn't get hooked on it. I think the main problem for me was the realtime aspect- There are so many decisions and factors to look at, why isn't this a turn based game? I found myself pausing and restarting the clock all the time, because I didn't want to miss anything while I was studying all the different aspects. When the clock was running, I kept thinking - should I pause it, am I missing something? Lots of great ideas and concepts, but I just couldn't get into a comfortable flow that felt ""fun"". A couple secondary things - the graphics of ships, planets, and starbases, etc are gorgeous when zoomed in. Zoomed out, the info placeholders are just ugly to look at by comparison. Also mouse control - having to hold down scroll wheel and dragging mouse to pan the view was just counter-intuitive, couldn't find a way to change that. It will pan if you move the cursor to the edge, but then you get menus popping up -as you end up mousing over the various menu icons.

I have not seen one movie within the game. Master of Orion and Endless Space 2 are loaded with artistic movies. They put no effort into that. The interface was not given any attention when compared to Endless Space 2 and also has to be modded, luckily for the game there are options. I do love that the game is not turned based.

The DLC content is always something any other less scummy business would be putting out as a free update because it's not justifiable to charge for.

1607,76561198293649672,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198293649672/,"By far the best part of Stellaris is empire creation. It's a big part of why I even bought the game - the menu is robust and intuitive, you have plenty of opportunity for roleplaying and customisation and deciding how your designs appear ingame is easy. The downside is definitely the flag section; for some reason they chose a few nice, flag-friendly colours, then threw in every ugly one they could think of. There's not even a white. A few of the emblems look good, but most of them won't work well because they're this gross dirty brass colour - the game really needs some all-white/black emblems. Pretty much the only vanilla flag I've seen that looks good is the Commonwealth of Man, which makes me think they probably designed the system around it since it's basically their mascot empire. Luckily it's really easy to mod in these features. The real problems with the game come when you actually play it. Unless you force them all to be replaced with your designs, most of the empires are randomly generated, or in other words, are god-awful. They're so bad. Not only do they sound - well, like they were randomly generated from a txt - the vast majority will be some random authority type with some bland civics that you use as filler on your handmade empires. I'm not kidding when I say at least half of all the AI empires I've seen had reanimated armies and/or functional architecture. I always end up manually tweaking the gamestate file. I'd much prefer if the devs could create a load of good-looking (the pre-packaged empires aren't much better), thought-out empires, or hell, make it easier for us to download others' designs. It also doesn't affect your empire much. The difference between Imperial Authority and Democratic Authority is that Democratic Authority randomly changes the portrait you see when you accidentally open the Government page every 10 years, and Imperial Authority changes it to a smaller portrait that was sitting below that one once they die. Roleplay is fine, but I really don't think it'd be that hard to code in a little political flavour with the events system. I'm not exagerrating - they literally DON'T DO ANYTHING except a rare completely laughable ""unpopular leader"" event that gives a happiness debuff for a few months. There's almost a bit of tension when you realise succession wars are an option if your monarch dies without an heir, except then you notice you always have an heir, and according to some maths done by Jasoni22 on Reddit it turns out that there's literally a 0.00000074% chance of going ONE YEAR without an heir spawning. So that was a pointless feature. Also, when an election is happening after your current leader dies (which you can get with any authority except Imperial, and will get with Dictatorial), for some reason they were too lazy to figure out who should fill the leader slot in the meantime? So it's just empty and all the text prompts that reference the ruler's name are broken. That's so lazy for a game that costs 35 quid without DLC. There's no characterisation beyond a few surface-level events. Obviously this isn't Stellaris' focus, but this is still a game with characters in it, and there's kinda no point when leaders amount to traits that get replaced by some other traits once they die every 100 years. I can't connect with anyone which leaves everything feeling distant which isn't what you want in a sci-fi game given the entire genre is about feeling like you're in a world beyond our own. There needs to be at least some basic character development implemented so I actually care about the leader. The events themselves are underwhelming. One of the biggest moments in my latest playthrough (a heavily modded run as a fanatic xenophile direct democracy, the Shena Republics) was achieving the Synth technology, which basically lets you give robots sapience. By this point bots were the largest group in my empire, and I was roleplaying a lot, so I expected at least a pop-up saying it was done. Literally nothing. Thrilling. Every part of this game makes me feel like it doesn't want me to play it. Wars are handled weirdly. There's a war exhaustion system, but it doesn't do much - the main thing is to meet a bunch of prerequisites because they all give some insane 100+ negative to the change the AI will accept. It doesn't feel like I'm fighting a space empire, it feels like I'm fighting the game's surrender system. Occupation doesn't do much either - especially weird is how inconsequential the capital is? Like it's the centre of an empire LIGHTYEARS across with billions or trillions of citizens, the government is canonically centred there, it's the homeworld and generally most populated planet of the empire, why is the only consequence of the entire planet being occupied by a foreign power the same tiny +whatever points towards the AI deciding it's worth surrendering as literally any other planet? It should definitely be a crisis to lose any planet, let alone your entire capital (which should definitely at least lead to some sort of event chain about evacuating the central government). One feature I just don't understand are the enclaves. I've never used them. They just sit on the map with their ugly flags until I accidentally click on one of them then forget them again. Seriously, Paradox, what's the point of adding them if they aren't going to do anything while you ignore everything else that actually matters??? Federations are badly done. Because there's just not many empires on the map, it's basically down to luck if it's anything other than an exploit. The perks don't do much and there aren't really many federation-specific events (I'd really like some sort of way to propose uniting into one superstate once you reach the top level at least). There are a few - but they all require that EVERYONE in the federation contributes, which is a problem when Stellaris AI is involved because at least one will probably ignore it and let the special project time out which just stops the entire event chain and locks a paused timer onto your situatuon log forever. Again, at a basic level, why didn't the developers bother to consider that? And last - the absolute worst part of the game - the AI. It's not just bad, the AI is literally not fit for purpose, it DOES NOT WORK. If literally everything else I've mentioned here was fixed, I'd still not recommend Stellaris if the AI isn't completely overhauled, because the vast majority of Stellaris players play in singleplayer and even if they don't AI empires are still gonna be a major part of the experience. THE GAME FUNDAMENTALLY DOES NOT WORK . It hasn't worked since about the late 1.x updates, because new features (most of which I think were improvements) were not properly factored into the AI. The AI can't handle planets, it can't handle war, it can't handle megastructures, it can't handle fleet design, it can't handle ship distribution, it can't handle stations, it can't manage economy, it just doesn't work. If you look online all you'll find is horror stories of Prethoryn Scourge sending their ships off to f*** knows where while they upgrade far-off stations and wait for their systems to be effortlessly seiged down and AI sending massive corvette stacks into the shredder. It's not just weak, it actually causes lag with the amount of corvettes and habitats they put out. There's not one but TWO mods on the workshop which massively improve the AI, just by tweaking the priorities and using some sneaky AI-only events to make them actually build buildings. Paradox are investing into diplomacy in the latest DLC instead of MAKING THE GAME PLAYABLE, even though what's achievable with mods is nothing compared to what the devs themselves should be able to do with access to all the code. It's completely unacceptable. A £35 game should not rely on player-made mods just to function at a basic level. I can't recommend this game until at least the AI is fixed.",Not Recommended,6588.0,548.3 hrs on record,Posted: 11 April

I got “the unbidden” who appeared from another dimension and started murdering my outermost bases. They’re very strong but just about defeatable if I muster my entire, very large civilisation and plan well. It’s my first war (the whole galaxy loves me, somehow) and you know what? It could go one of 2 ways; I’ll either win or I’ll lose. And I’m not sure I care either way. So I haven’t bothered. The writing is great. I’d be very happy to experience more of it (I need me some worm in my life) but for the time investment? When all I’m doing for hours is balancing numbers? I’ve been a software engineer for 15 years and by now I guess I can hold a complex system in my head and understand its variables well, but I’m not so smart that I ace strategy games.

Most people have no idea what a debug menu is, and when a menu pops up in their screen in Stellars they are used to being able to press the escape key to escape the menu. This is the only menu in the game that cannot be closed with the escape key that I am aware of (maybe excluding the odd event,) yet is the easiest menu to accidentally open when trying to hit the escape key to open the primary game menu.

That would be forgivable if the game itself was at all fun.  It's not.  It's a boring slog of doing the same thing over and over.  The pace is unforgiveably slow.  And then in the mid- and late-game everything explodes into a hell of micromanagement because the AI advisors are absurdly bad at doing anything. I understand why some people like the game.  It's ""real time"" which means the 'next turn' phenomenon is always present: there's no natural starting or stopping point.  There's almost something minor that requires your attention. The problem is that peppering of minutae never lets up.  Nothing ever really feels epic (except, I guess for wars which themselves are long, drawn out, unfun affairs of literal attrition and petty claims).

They can't even get the buttons at the bottom of the planet window to match the clickable area for them resulting in lots of wasted time because you didn't click exactly right even though it's still clearly on the button. Performance is still a drag in late game resulting in what feels like 5 fps slide show when scrolling over the galaxy map. Ship and weapon balance is still lame, boring and vanilla.  Big ships are always better, there's no room for cool specialty ships.  Always run out of technologies to research by mid game year (2350).  The AI generally sucks and doesn't put up a decent challenge even on grand admiral unless you give it a huge resource bonus at the start in which case it just builds a giant fleet faster than you and kills you, there is no in between. Planet management is horrifyingly bad.  There is no conditional build queue.  For example, If you want to build a building and it requires another thing first, you have to build that first thing, wait a few minutes, find the planet again and build the 2nd part, the game doesn't indicate it's done.  The game doesn't tell you when a planet reaches 10 pops so you can upgrade it's ship shelter to a planetary administration building.  And did I mention the bugs with replacing districts?  If you want to replace several types of districts to another, you often have to do it twice as it won't let you do it all at once because of buggy math.  Worse is taking over a planet, and deleting all the useless districts and buildings you don't want.  Might as well play cookie clicker there's so much clicking required. The worst part is the whole game feels like a demo for all their overpriced DLC, with tons of DLC reminders and resources that don't do anything without DLC.

I have probably 50-60 hours in the game * One of the most boring strategy games I've ever played. Don't get fooled by the great reviews. They are overwhelmingly from ""Roleplayers"" who use this game as a backdrop to ... wait for it ... use their imagination. If the game mechanics are shallow or do not work, they will create ... a ""story"" ... in their heads like somehow an admiral was drunk on the job, etc ... instead of just saying the AI sucks. which it does by the way. Yes, another ""strategy"" game that has horrible AI. This game is also a meaningless click fest, and by meaningless .. i mean meaningless. Once example among MANY: The developers literally created a ""new mechanic"" called First Contact. Before, you clicked and was introduced to a NPC. Now, with this great brand new mechanic .. you read,click,wait .... then read,click,wait ...... then read,click,wait ..... then read,click,wait .... and when i say click, it literally an ""OK"" button. I could go on and on. The short of it is ... if you are a mature person who doesn't live in a fantasy world and is looking for a 4x space strategy game which REAL depth and REAL meaningful game mechanics that actually have REAL influence in the world within the game .. this is not it.

Now. I am aware that, generally speaking, products ""wear out"" over time. My shoes wear out. My kitchen knife wears out. The gasket on my automatic timer for my garden hose will eventually wear out. My router will eventually wear out. And so will the SSD this copy of Windows is running on. Things ""wear out"" after a certain period of time, until you can no longer use them. Update: I would advise people to have enough headroom when running this game. Performance seems to have been improved because of how pops are handled with the new update, but even before the update, with 32gb of RAM, the game has only crashed once. Even with 16, I should have less than 0 problems, so I'm probably an anomaly, but it's still my experience. Have the beefiest system possible, even if you want to play not-demanding games. My question is, should not such a phenomenon *not* happen with software, so long as it's current and updated? It would be like saying Steam will no longer run on someone's computer because they had been running it for ~300 hours. Or Firefox. Or any piece of software for that matter. Heck, I'm pretty sure there are Atari cartridges out there right now that run if you plug them into a working system. I can play ET on an Atari, but not Stellaris on PC. Sure, I could buy the console version, but it wouldn't be the same. So, that's it for me. It was a magnificent 320 hours, and it's a downright tragedy it happened right before Nemesis dropped, but I really can't even start a new game without it crashing immediately, even with no mods at all. Mind you, I had a few mods, not more than 10, but maybe close to it. And I can understand the game crashing here and there when something really huge happens, like large and constant population shifts, especially when it's end game with a large galaxy, lots of empires, max settings and everything. But I'm not even doing all that. I legit can't even start a normal, vanilla game in a small galaxy, so there's no way I can even play this any longer, much less buy Nemesis when it comes out. So no. I do not recommend Stellaris at all.

1787,76561197976565082,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197976565082/,"This is at its core an excellent game, so I do recommend it. It does suffer from two major flaws though: -vicious business practices with a game segmented into a billion DLC -disastrous UI for a game of this genre The first point is pretty much self-evident, so I'll only talk about the second one. First, the UI doesn't display enough information at once, and is not scaled properly with your screen's definition. Thankfully, this is mostly fixable via mods, but it clearly shouldn't be the case in the first place. Second, a few UI elements are evidently poorly thought-out. For example, there are icons showing when a planet is overpopulated in some way. They only show up when there is a problem. It should be mind-bogglingly obvious to any play-tester that such warnings should come BEFORE the problem shows up, not AFTER it does. Third, some gameplay mechanics require so much micromanagement because of the game's poor UI that I simply try to forget about them. For example, you can create robotic population on your planets. It's obviously a very cool concept, and in theory it's also a very strong move, but in reality, having to handle all the overpopulation problems that come with it makes it so much of a chore that I just don't bother anymore. Fourth, the game lacks a proper warning system. A game like Stellaris is very, very long, with, accordingly, very long periods of downtime, where you have nothing to do. Ideally, the way you'd want to play the game is to have it play on fast-forward at all times, and only stop whenever you need to decide on something. A planet completed a building? The game should stop and let you choose the next one. An adjacent empire started invading you? The game should stop as you dispatch your fleets to deal with the invasion. This game, of course, tries to provide such a system, but very much fails at doing so, and it doesn't allow you to fix it yourself. Fifth, some elements of this game's UI are simply bugged. Heavily so. For example, your shipyards' construction queues will often end up permanently backed up with fake construction projects that you can never cancel and that never end. I need to insist on the term ""often"" here. By often, I mean that I have never played a single game where this was not a problem. It is downright infuriating that this sort of bug, in such a central part of the game could not be fixed after years of development. But I guess Paradox is too busy making DLCs to make the base game actually work. Thankfully there are mods to attenuate some of these problems, otherwise it'd be nearly unplayable. A minor inconvenience, but stupid one anyway is how Paradox keeps locking achievements away under the exceedingly harsh prerequisites of playing a vanilla, ironman game in all of their releases. Let it be clear once and for all: I will never play a Paradox game vanilla, and I will never play a Paradox game in ironman. Why make your game moddable if you're going to spit on your player base for modding it? I just don't get it. It's not very important, but it's definitely a bit of a shame because achievements serve as very good pretexts in this game to try out new civilizations or gameplay mechanics. In the end I still mostly do them, but without the unlocking part. Hard to imagine what went through their heads when they decided to do that.",Recommended,2745.0,96.2 hrs on record,Posted: 16 August

I don't know if I'll write reviews for each of the DLC releases but I'll say that despite thinking ""oh my god it would cost almost $200 to get all of these!"" at first, I slowly purchased each of them over time and have found them to be worth it. There are so many ways to customize and play this game that you could spend years designing races, factions, and game mechanics and not get bored. With friends, it can be an RPG playground that rivals tabletop games in storytelling.

While I personally don't enjoy the game, my dad (an avid player of Master of Orion and Starcraft in his younger days) does enjoy killing time with it. I did not enjoy the game, it feels like the developers really wanted ""Real Time"" RTS. Most people would probably be more interested in something faster paced like Starcraft or Master of Orion, both of which usually have games that last under 4 hours. An average game in Stellaris is about 15 hours with the maximum fast forward speed of x3. The same amount of time as a League of Legends session (or so I'm led to believe). The game is a bit too complex for a newer player, with several economies that are explained in 45 minute YouTube videos apiece and having to do literally everything for yourself. It honestly feels like a prolonged escort mission, having to hold everybody's hand at the same time and trying not to let the empire implode. And not to mention the game is big too, the smallest map for a single player mode is something like 800 systems and that's going to take a long time when you consider that you will be forced to wait for ingame months to pass by as your ships slowly putter across the expanse of the universe.

1852,MoriNoHogosha,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MoriNoHogosha/,"A bit of history of my time in this game... Within days of starting this up years ago, I realized Stellaris wasn't as complete and polished as it should have been. Even with a few DLCs, I knew it was missing a lot of tweaks that should have been in here at launch, not just the extra species, ship designs, eye candy, or other nice-to-haves. So I stacked on I-don't-recall-how-many mods and got into it for well over 100 hours. It was mostly okay on its own back then, but mods really added a lot of QOL and visual enhancements, along with a slew of mechanical conveniences and tactical goodies, making it go from ""okay"" to ""excellent"". However, things started to bog down after a while, or stopped working, or just crashed too often. And after more updates finally broke all my mods and my saved games would no longer load, I simply dropped this. To be fair, I was undoubtedly spoiled by the workshop goodies, so much that I didn't want to bother taking another stab at all of it mod-less. Fast forward to 2021... Having had my fill of other genres and stuck with a nagging craving for something different, word of this new generation of Stellaris was enough to convince me that maybe I should give this another go. Long story short, this was totally worth the revisit! Stellaris 3.0 is leaps beyond what it was at initial launch. Just going by the number of hours I've apparently logged recently, there are enough improvements that maybe I don't really miss all the modded goodies... Okay, yes I do, though to a lesser extent than before. There are still a lot of things that would be ""nice to have"", because let's face it, this monster can turn into micromanagement hell!

I used to love playing Space Empires 4, but that game was never balanced well and ended up being quite tedious due to the simple impracticality of having to create new ship designs every time you got technology. Stellaris has the same feel, but managed to actually balance the game to have fun game play, while still allowing you to do things like design your own ships if you really want to (but they auto-generate designed based on your tech for you if you don't want the hassle). Truthfully, the ai cannot hold a candle to human intelligence, so to make the game more challenging you need to handicap yourself with challenging origins and game conditions (such as the doomsday origin, ironman mode, and eliminating guaranteed habitable planets near your homeworld). The ai isn't horrible, it just doesn't adapt very well to what the human player is doing (especially regarding splitting or combining fleets as necessary to counter an opponent's strategy). The ai is also terrible about specializing their worlds, which is a significant handicap on all types of production. This game is very fun if you enjoy role-playing as a space-faring civilization or if you simply enjoy the act of taking a civilization from humble beginnings to greatness. There are many play-styles you can choose, and ""completing"" a game can take quite a long time. The pace of this game can be adapted to fit whatever you want, since it can be paused at any time, and I believe has 5 speeds that you can switch between whenever you want.

Lots of pretty screenshots haunt my harddrive, and expansion of these graphics by mods make for a very visually lovely experience. Gameplay: Stellaris does what a lot of other RTS or turn-based scifi does not by embracing the wierd and whacky side of space as well as the explorer as actual events, decisions and a lot of ""what the heck is that?"" It can provide also for some large fleet battles (while limited in how the combat itself progresses) and it's worst point is planetary invasions (I'd want for some mini game or something a little more graphically interesting rather then red lines appearing on icons.)

I didn't had so much fun in 4x since Galactic Civilizations 2 and Distant Worlds. This game is a masterpiece, pure and simple. The only issue i'm having is a boring mid-game, when you are waiting for your first mid game crisis and there is virtually nothing to do, I wish that at least anomalies would re-appear from time to time and there would be more events.

I like them but they are far from my favorite. This game is in a league all of its own. There are so many different things all blended together so well to keep me coming back over and over to play a new campaign. The freedom to create the species and government that you really want is staggering. I've been humans who just wanted to explore the galaxy and find its secrets. I've been sapient mushrooms who wish to enslave the entire galaxy. I've been robots who want to assimilate all biological beings into their collective. And there's still SO SO many more to try! The replay-ability of this game is truly something wonderful. Finding new archaeology sites to excavate, researching powerful new technologies. Annihilating a fallen empire who made you free all your slaves 100 years in the past on pain of destroying your civilization. NOW with 3.0 and nemesis there is building a spy network to steal technologies or even arm pirates to distract the fleets of an enemy. And becoming the crisis is a pretty fun mechanic I've been messing around with. I used to think the DLCs were overly priced but not anymore. Paradox is not a massive company. They have a small base of constant players compared to huge AAA developers. Each DLC is optional and is usually always released with free updates. All of the DLCs are totally worth the price too. Paradox keeps the game fresh, always adding new mechanics and interesting things to try. I've been playing this game and getting each new DLC as it comes out and still i consider it quite complicated. For new players Id recommend getting the base game and learning it, trying it out. Then getting the DLCs you want. It may be overwhelming at first to a person just jumping in, but stick it out! learn it! Save your game and keep trying. Once you really grasp it it becomes very fun! All in all this is a fantastic game that I'd recommend to anyone. 10/10 Id be a race of xenophobic mushrooms who want to enslave the galaxy again!",Recommended,1696.0,584.5 hrs on record,Posted: 7 August

I usually play with AI mods that make it smarter but when I want to earn achievements in a game I play without them. Multiplayer is a thing too in this game.

The game is very limited in building and progression options.  Apparently, they changed how you can obtain influence which is essential for expanding your empire.  When you obtain factions, you basically just stop gaining influence after it was only a 3 gain flat increase, with no way to increase that number.  Somehow, it can become a loss without any reason from the game itself.  It eventually just runs down to zero with no control from the player, which means it just stops you from expanding.  You are left sitting there waiting while you are not able to do anything about growth in the game. I was left unable to build tall as well, because my new colonies were left unable to build a second building.  They only start out with one building, and none of those buildings allow you to get to 10 population.  It requires 10 population to upgrade your starting building to allow more housing.  Yes, I tried going luxury housing first, but you still have the same problem from crime taking over before it reaches pop 10. Basically, this game is now junk.  I am left feeling brain dead playing for hours hoping that I could gain influence or reach 10 population in a colony.   After two days, I give up.

There's just so much to learn here. If you enjoy slow, detailed, precise simulations of empire building, especially in a sci-fi setting, and especially with a great degree of freedom, this is for you. One can emulate any number of tropes, from the despotic, militaristic empires of Star Wars to the pacifistic, scientific republics of Star Trek. Alternatively, one can build one's own vision of a galaxy-spanning civilization. Do you want to be a Venice-style merchant republic? go for it. Wanna be an honor-driven warrior culture with healthy respect for the traditions of other cultures? absolutely. Want to literally just be Starship Troopers? sure. HOWEVER: This game takes eons to learn. Again, I have 20 hours in the thing, and I still don't feel like I know anything. The tutorials are nigh on uselessness for the teaching of the UI, which is absolutely monumental. I understand that people don't want handholding in their strategy games, but when you are never told that you need a certain tech to build a certain building, or that your starbase has to be at a certain level to produce ships, the game can feel extremely frustrating, especially for new players relying on the tutorial to teach them the game. Ultimately, if you want to learn how to play, you are going to have to watch several hours of YouTube content to even reach a basic understanding of how the game operates. 10/10 would exterminate filthy xenos scum again",Recommended,1269.0,23.3 hrs on record,Posted: 1 August

This is one of those kinds of games; one where you start it up, get through the first few tutorial turns and go ""what in the name of Gaben is going on here?"" before you're thrown into galactic politics and a scramble to become a major player before the AI, or other players. It's incredibly fun once you understand the concepts, but I strongly reccomend watching a youtube tutorial before even starting up. A lot of the fun does NOT come from winning, however. It comes from the roleplaying element; it's fun to be, say, isolationist space dwarves; or a tree-person hive mind... or whatever you want to build. I've made the cult of the damned, space elves, communist pelicans and the Terran Imperium of Man, and had them all duke it out in front of me. There is, certainly, a meta; tech, tech, etch! Vassalize other empires and build your economy so you can build a defensive force, boost your tech, and then doomstack. But, it requires a lot of setup, and there's a reasonable chance that you can do something else incredibly fun and powerful without having to abide by any meta (spiritualists still suck though). This is my first 4X/Grand Strategy game, and I can highly reccomend it.

I'm still saying its a great game and if you enjoy 4x strategy games, this is your pick, trust me. However, the game lacks when it comes to in depth details, such as political systems of empires, and relations with other empires. If you are looking to play something similar to Hearts of Iron or Crusader Kings this might not be what you're looking for. Additionally, the DLCs man. 15$/£. Megastructures simply eclipse any other production method in the game. You can have thousands of empty planets filled with 1000s of pops supported by one dyson sphere. As well as AI not managing to build anything more... grand than a gateway for 200 years, the game lacks if played by yourself and you are a person expecting a challenge. So I do recommend playing with a friend, but you've read this far into a steam review of Stellaris and I've written this much that it seems obvious neither of us have many friends.

Personally I have all the DLC as I enjoy the game, but just try the base game out first and then buy the DLC, there are plenty of ranking lists out there for which you should pick up in the order. The massive cost of the DLC now is daunting but you don't need any of it to enjoy this game and not having it isn't an issue as in multiplayer, only the host needs DLC. The only other problem the game suffers is performance in the late game, even on high end PC's this is a problem and is currently one of the only problems with this game.

Now, I do want to let this be known that I don't typically review games, but I felt Stellaris deserved it because it's a damn good game. One thing I would like to let you know is that in order to play multiplayer with game-changing mods every player needs to have every mod loaded in the same order (this will be shown in-game through the checksum value). Overall I really love this game, if my 100+ hours (at the time of writing) doesn't convince you that I enjoy this game I don't know what will. It's a damn good strategy game and it can get even better with the sheer amount of mod support it has. Now, I do have a few minor issues with the game that I will address here. First one is that this thing can lag late-game pretty hard depending on the size of the fleets battling and if you are watching them do battle. I have a decent computer (1050Ti + 32GB of RAM) and I can still encounter minor loading hiccups from time to time with events.

But it felt like it didn’t reach the full potential of expanding the series into space. Well, maybe that’s not quite fair.  It might be better to say that each game of C:BE focuses on a single planet, while each game of Stellaris focuses on a single galaxy.  Everything is just bigger, with more options for achieving a goal.  The fact that there’s loads more DLC helps, too.  But both games are phenomenal. Both games are also *long*, too.  Don’t expect to finish a single game in one sitting!  Perhaps it’s possible in either game if you crank down the settings for a very small planet/galaxy.  But it’s not the “normal” default.  (On the other hand, that’s part of the appeal.  Building up in either game is slow but satisfying.

2327,blt185,https://steamcommunity.com/id/blt185/,"Grand Strategy Games Freed from the Tedium of Turns I enjoy grand strategy games like Civilization V and Galactic Civilizations III a lot, I like them because unlike in real-time strategy games, there are multiple ways of going about winning and war doesn't have to be the only path forward. The only problem I find with them most of the time is that turns make the game take way longer than it could be otherwise. I played multiplayer sessions of the other two aforementioned games, and what bugged me the most was that I had some friends who would take FOREVER with their turns, which in turn usually meant that the game never really got anywhere. Stellaris doesn't have this problem, because it removes the turn system. In addition, Stellaris has one of the most robust race and and government customization of any 4X game I've ever played. The government you choose actually has a function on how your government and species function, in ways that are reflected in the gameplay. For example, I found myself playing the mega-corp style government (what can I say I love business), who's main perk comes from building corporate offices on the worlds of other races and building add-ons that benefit not only you, but the race that you built the office on; and that's only one example. The events that happen in the galaxy are reflected on the map, and effect the game in a tangible way. For example, I had a play-through that ended in disaster when I reached a point where I could open some sort of ancient star-gates. Unbeknownst to me, it was the only thing keeping an apocalyptic nano-swarm contained; and so I doomed the entire galaxy to a death by being consumed by the grey-goo. I wasn't wanting that to happen, but I still had a blast with it. My main complaint with the game mostly has to do with how much DLC there is and how much it costs. There are types of races that you cannot play as unless you bought the DLC (however, this doesn't stop you from playing multiplayer with people who have them which is definitely nice). The only other thing that may be an issue for some is that getting your feet on the ground can be a bit difficult, especially if you aren't used to 4X games, so just make sure you're aware of that going in. Overall, I'd rate Stellaris a 9/10. It really is a great, well-rounded game. The only thing holding it back from perfection for me was the abundant and expensive DLC., but you can still have a really good time regardless if you enjoy the concept of literally creating your own civilization.",Recommended,2079.0,34.0 hrs on record,Posted: 21 July

I created a humanoid race, named them the Cevanti.  When I started I got all this flavor text about how the Cevanti came to their homeworld on an Ark ship from Earth.  Okay, fine.  Then when they started leaving their homeworld and exploring other planets, I got all this story flavor about how they are discovering they aren't alone in this galaxy.  Okay, fine, but they should already know there are other humanoids like themselves back on earth.  Then the first ""alien civ"" we ran in to was humans, from Earth in the Sol system.  Hey, they reunited, cool right?  No, my people were fanatic purifiers, so when they ""discovered"" this ""disgusting alien race"" they vowed to exterminate them.  Okay, but you already knew about these humans, and according to the flavor text, they're the same race as yourselves... So yeah, this just doesn't add up. Other than this, the game is great so far. I just thought this might be a good place to report contradictory story text to the team.  To potential buyers, get Utopia DLC with the game.  You need it.

Some of them add things that you won't necessarily see in the game depending on your empire, so if you're on the fence I'd give the base game a try and then optionally buy the DLC you think you'll enjoy.

In short, you can make your own faction, explore and conquer the galaxy, with a lot of ways to customize the experience. However, one major downside: -The game thrives on content. To play the full experience, essentially you need to buy all the DLC, which puts the total price tag at about USD $120 or even more. That is a LOT.

There is also so many unique ways to play and win too, and there is a definitive system for winning too, unlike the other Paradox games where the game ends at the time limit.

It may sound odd to many to use the word ""adventure"" in regards to a 4X strategy game, but watching the story unfold and reading through the various discoveries really does create a solid narrative experience in the background of a solid strategy game. I would go so far as to say that I enjoy Stellaris more than Crusader Kings. If I have complaints, they are primarily two in number: 1) Many aspects of the game are not well explained, even with the tutorial turned on; and 2) the higher difficulty levels are achieved by simply ""cheating"" in favor of the AI players by giving them extra resources.

It is quality, and I would say if you can find it on sale for $10 as I did then it is 100% worth it.  If you do not positively know that these type of fiddly strategy games are for you then it is a bit of a gamble.  First, the bad.  The tutorial is non-existent, and you will need to play a few games on lower difficulty to figure out how to hunt through the menus to perform certain actions.  The interface is not very intuitive, and you do need to hunt for certain specific things.  I also believe that the pace of the game can be so slow as to be boring at times further pushing my statement that if these types of games are not for you then you might think twice about purchasing this title.  Now, the good.  This game fills a niche that few other games exist for, and it is an excellent empire building strategy game (if you love fiddly bits you will love this game).  Although I did complain about certain aspects of the inferface, a very good thing about it is that if you mouse over most things it will tell you how to effect that thing (resource, standing, etc).

Also, there is a certain level of micromanagement that is required to just play the game that can make it feel a bit less like a game and a bit like work. But don't get discouraged.

It has a fairly steep learning curve when you're getting into it but it's more than worth the time. The only real negatives I could point out are that the randomising other empires can be a bit unimaginative after a while but this is something you can fix with mods or yourself by deciding who is going to 'in'.

Before you shame me, please know that I’ve collected these hours over a five-year span, and that I have a habit of falling asleep while the game is still running, and reading or grading papers when the game universe becomes so large that my poor laptop slows to a crawl. Still, by anyone’s measure I have played a lot (almost certainly too much) of Stellaris, and on the basis of this long experience I can unequivocally say that it is a great game, and that if you’re on the fence you should buy it. I’ve seen the complaints that the DLCs (which account for a lot of the game’s outstanding replay value) are too expensive. That there are balance issues when it comes to advanced-start empires. That the game lags on anything but a dedicated gaming rig (see above). All these are valid points. But the diverse and immersive storytelling! The dedication to graphic detail! The complex-yet-not-overwhelming mechanics! The whimsical easter eggs! The soundtrack! The constant efforts by Paradox to rejigger and retool! Stellaris is a very good game. No; I’ll go beyond this: Stellaris is the escape we all need right now. Worried/terrified about our seemingly bleak climate future? In Stellaris, you can not only aggressively fight for the environmental purity of your planets, but learn about possible scientific advances that might one day be used on ours. Wish you could suppress or encourage certain political beliefs in your IRL nation? Doing so in Stellaris is genuinely cathartic. Life too complicated? Start a new game, enter a clean universe of vast possibility over, and over, and over. This last, for me, is the true pleasure of Stellaris, and the reason I’ve spent so much time with the game. In all those hours, I’ve only ever completed two, maybe three games. But I don’t care. For me, a game of Stellaris is a form of meditation.",Recommended,1577.0,"1,028.0 hrs on record",Posted: 6 July

I recently rewatched Stargate, and it is remarkable how often the plot reminds me to things I experienced in Stellaris. Same goes for Star Wars and Star Trek. But there are not only stereotypical sci-fi tropes like machine races, planet destroying or shielding weapons, stargates themselfs, wormholes, hiveminds and so on, but also brilliant deep diving stories and own ideas. Even after 200+ hours I got to knew new things every playthrough. If you read sci-fi books, its almost like finding easter eggs in every corner of the game. Another great thing is the music. ""Assambling the Fleet, ""A better Tomorrow"" and ""Finding Sanctuary"" are masterpieces of music! Really, some of those compositions touched my soul! I hear them in my car from now and then, and it made me able to leave our planet for multiple times. Stellaris is one of my all time favorites, I can't recommend more, even if its hard to get in. After all I readed its one of the most beginner-friendly games from Paradox. If you need guides, watch out for recent ones, as the game evolved extremely since release.

Later, however, everything gets a little bit boring because you don't feel like your decisions have a big impact. For example, what to choose to research is pretty much a random thing, at least to me. The fact that your leaders get levels and get better is great, there are many perks they can get, but such a level of micromanagement in the mid and late-game seems a bit unnecessary. And yeah, you don't have to manage any of those things directly later, but then what is left to you? The market allows to buy and see many resources almost at any time, thus making each of them kinda similar to others. Managing planets is actually the same story, you can just put it on autopilot. The same goes for the custom fleet construction. As you expand you get penalized and your progress slows down, so you might need to release subjects (vassals), etc. What is left for you to do is global decisions like a declaration of war. It's a great game, don't get me wrong. There are many good ideas implemented, like traditions, which is something between a thing from Civilization and ideas from Europa, but at the end of the day, the fact that this universe is purely fictional is not good for the game, because you just don't too much attach to a visual nation that has no real-world history, etc. When I started playing this game I had a great experience, but after a while, with like 10+ years in Victoria 2, and a few years with Europa 4, I think Stellaris is behind them in terms of the overall fun for me personally.",Recommended,1320.0,7.2 hrs on record,Posted: 5 July

I'd still continue playing it to seek more depth into the anomalies and side missions, and the ""failed empire"" mechanic adds a layer of complexity to your expansion plans. A couple of points I'd find as carry overs from DWU, which weren't fixed, are that you don't know which one's your nearest ship to an event (scientific/build/military) and the fleet management seems a bit cumbersome.

2839,MrAlbum321,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrAlbum321/,"See comments for full review. Basics: Stellaris is a real-time 4X strategy game with pause-anytime mechanics. A VERY robust customization system for your galactic civilization leads to in-game choices and events that make every run a unique experience every time. There are lots of mechanics and systems to learn, but you can take your time especially in single player to grok and understand all the options at your disposal. There are LOTS of in-game events both beneficial and harmful. In the mid-game and late-game, Crises spawn that threaten the survival of the entire galaxy. Defeat these Crises, or risk getting subjugated or annihilated. That's your overall win condition, though you can set a custom win condition if you desire. Strengths: The Role-Play is STRONG with this game. SOOOO many options, SOOOO many choices that matter, SOOOO many game-defining events that dictate how your game will go at any point in time. The pause-anytime mechanic is GENIUS in allowing newbies to ease into the overwhelming complexity of the game. Varied mechanics and events give unique flavor every run. This results in no two empires with identical starts ending identically. Very high production values that are atypical for this kind of intergalactic 4X game. Sleek UI that clearly shows what options do what, and allow players to make decisions at their own pace via the pause-anytime mechanic. Legacy support for older versions is baked into the game client. Your 1.0 Stellaris game can still be played despite the game currently being in the 3.0 update cycle. That also means legacy mods can still be used, despite being compatible for older versions of the game, leading to a VERY robust modding scene. Weaknesses: Balance and performance issues. The devs through expansions and DLCs threw a LOT of stuff at the wall, and not all of it sticks. You lose out on a LOT of content without all the expansions and DLCs, meaning you need to shell out the money or plain miss out. The devs are FINALLY addressing game balance, but be ready for a LOT of stuff to break or change as a result. Multiplayer is jank, and VERY insular. Very specific kinds of players will enjoy it, but new and casual players discovering the game for the first time would do well to stick to single player. Even if you have friends to play with, one game of Stellaris could take HOURS, if not DAYS, to finish. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Conclusion: Get the game for the journey, not the destination. Take your time, savor its tremendous variety, get messy, make mistakes, and above all, create fun stories to share with your friends and gamer pals. Your empty wallet is a valid sacrifice for an experience you will find nowhere else. If you can't shell out the dough, then hold off until you can.",Recommended,2289.0,804.7 hrs on record,Posted: 1 July

2845,CrustaceanSoup,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CrustaceanSoup/,"There's a stupid amount of content here, and lots of fun roleplaying opportunities, more than your typical 4X like Civilization. You can be galactic tyrants, enslaving other species, burning planets that are in your way, teaming up with interdimensional monsters. You can be weird plant people who love other species and get bonuses from living on diverse planets. There's diplomacy, there's internal power struggles, there's neat plot lines around artifacts and galaxy-shaking events. No game is the same, and that's before you start modding and/or playing multiplayer. The DLC is expensive and that sucks but also it adds even more content on top of a game that already has a whole lot of it so it's hard to complain. The downsides are mostly the normal 4X problems. AI diplomacy is sort of stupid. You'll usually gradually expand by opportunistically warring against neighbours that are weaker or are engaged in wars with other factions, and the galaxy as a whole will mostly ignore your expansionism until it's too late. Combat exists but it's mostly a case of doom stacks against doom stacks, and choke points may not exist at all so terrain/positioning is not much of a thing. Late game can be a slog if you play on a larger galaxy, but you usually want to play on a larger galaxy so that early/mid game feel ""grand"" in scale. A problem that doesn't exist in the likes of EU and CK is that there are often no ""oceans"" or other neutral territory, so war and expansion might be constrained to your immediate neighbours, which can be problematic depending on your placement. Another thing: characters (who can be planetary governors, fleet admirals, etc.) exist but unlike CK they feel like an unnecessary feature that gets in the way rather than adding any depth. You have to replace them when they die, it's just annoying, there's no political intrigue or family ties or other stuff to have them actually add spice to the game.",Recommended,1602.0,130.2 hrs on record,Posted: 1 July

There are many ways to play and the game can accommodate most of them quite well, from aggressive expansion to diplomatic exploration. If there is a failing of Stellaris, it is that the game has been sold in pieces, a few of the DLC feel like they should have just been included in the base game (Federations and species packs) while others provide a unique experience that you may be glad can be separated from the base game depending on your play style. Is it the game worth full price?  Yes, but the DLC is not.  If you just want the base experience, purchase away and you'll get 100+ hours of playtime easy.

As usual, they release the game and then trickle DLCs down as the years progress.  One thing about their titles, they get support for 8+ years.  Most complain about the ""DLC Fest"" but then are the first ones to pre-order a 60 dollar game, get mad, and throw a huge tantrum.  Spending 60 every few months is far more than paying 10-20 dollars per DLC eveyr few months. Stellaris is a typical grand strategy game that is different every time you play.  So many combinations of race characteristics and government/civics end up in a different debacle each time.  This is good, it keeps you on your toes, and the random galaxy generation always adds a bit of spice.  Are you at the center of the spiral or do you have a secular section with only a few ways in on the far ends of the galaxy?  Can you handle a late-game alien invasion that requires the combined effort of everyone (unless you cheese it)? As usual, the tutorial, while decent, needs work.  Youtube can help here, as always.  So many different resources and aspects to your galactic empire means there is always something to do.  Fight, trade, take over planets (or destroy them), become an ascended race, and have the highest overall score by the year 2500.  I really do enjoy the in-depth strategy games that we have in this era of gaming, where most other games are terrible or duplicates of last years model. In the end, the music is great, graphics are immersive, and the ability to play your way, for as long as you like (do not have to stop at 2500) makes this game worth a shot.  I have played hundreds of hours on the Xbox Console version and now am starting on the PC version as I wanted to play with a friend and form a federation that will stomp anyone in our way.",Recommended,1453.0,18.1 hrs on record,Posted: 30 June

Mousewheel problem can be half fixed by using mods for more compact sidebar for example. It is fine in early game when all your lists are small, but try playing on a medium or larger galaxy. You will have to reach out to that tiny scroll knob on every turn so it becomes at least a little bearable. On the contrary zooming in and out in the glorious 3D that game advertizes so much in screenshots, mousewheel shoots from ""very far"" to ""very near"" with just a tiny tap of the mousewheel... too fast! Talk about consistency. How can you spectate the events when you can't even zoom the way you want? Oh, and the game engine overrides whatever Windows mousewheel speed settings you have. Speaking of mods, they disable Steam achievements unless they are like the beforementioned - cosmetic/QoL mods. If you change your mods, don't just blindly continue your save! Try starting a new game because in that menu it will tell you if achievements will be available or not. And then comes the endgame popup hell that you can't disable (without a mod that will make you lose achievements) where you get notified of every single thing that happen in AI <-> AI politics. It won't even forget to remind you when your leaders level up! :D You will do absolutely nothing with that information because there are no skill allocations or others to worry about. All in all i can live with its (easily fixable by devs!) faults for now, gritting teeth a little every now and then... Make sure to change start settings before you go at it, the defaults are hard! My first game i let AI decide what to build in systems and it made it simpler, but there was 2 ancient races in the galaxy which i was supposed to surpass somehow before year 2500. That proved to be an impossibility which i eventually gave up. They quickly colonized half the galaxy and roam with fleets that are even at 100k level. AI is also good at getting back what it lost, so attacking its systems with 1 big fleet is like clearing a small lake of water by shooting at it with a big cannon ball... It makes the way but it fills back up behind.

I've been around since you were given a choice on jump drives at the start of the game and since then it has been a roller coaster of changes to the point that it really no longer plays like it first did. The decisions you make regarding the species you encounter do have lasting effects on how the game plays out especially when it comes to the alliances you form and break. Do you need DLC to get the full experience? No. Does it enrich an already impressive game? Absolutely . The graphics are amazing with my only complaint being the size of the ships. Now there is mods that can fix this issue but as quickly as this game updates, mods usually get left behind for a week or longer depending on how often the creator keeps up the games update pace. You can get anything from a Star Wars mod (which are very well done) to StarCraft, Warhammer and possibly more with them having their own ship set (most of the time). The game itself does slow down towards end game since the game uses a single core on your PC. It does drag some but if you got a decent machine, it runs fine. I started playing this on a computer built in 2010 and worked just fine. I've upgraded since then but lower end PCs should have zero issue. TLDR Its a good game for 4x lovers. Me being a long time Civ fan, I feel right at home.

Half the galaxy lies in ruins, and trillions of lives have been lost due to subsequent invasions by the Gray Tempest and the Unbidden from another dimension. Although the Arvii people were originally a smaller, pacifistic, spiritualist and xenophile community, their place as fighting the Tempest on the front lines and winning when other empires could not earned them the permanent seat as the head of the Galactic Community. The threats enabled a particularly ambitious Emperor of the Arvii to propose the Galactic Imperium for a more safe and secure society. With thunderous applause, this was agreed to by the remaining star empires. This enabled the construction of a Grand Galactic Armada, and the Imperium was born. Sweeping across the Galactic North, the Empire reasserted control and colonized previously devastated systems, turning them into worlds teeming with factories and training camps, filled with refugees and survivors all wishing to take revenge on the Unbidden. It is said that the Empire was always at war with the Unbidden. The entire identity of the Arvii changed into a military-hardened Pan-Galactic state learning to use jump drives and wormholes to lay ambushes as the hunt for the dimensional anchors continued in order to close the unbidden portal. The process took more than 200 years and there are entire generations that have never known peace (unless you lived in the core worlds or served in the First Fleet, whose job was to prevent pirates from taking advantage of the chaos as they had done before). We only knew war. Now, the galaxy must rebuild and has entered into a Pax Galactica. Where can the Empire go from here? Seriously, with Nemesis and all the content this has truly become an Epic GSG. The depth in the economy and ability to do what you desire to create a Galactic State of your choosing is unparalleled. I do have some reservations about the Crises after this game and FINALLY finishing. On the one hand, they do make the endgame not very easy and rather exciting, something a lot of strategy games fail to do. On the other hand, the Unbidden in particular are absolutely broken because of the dimensional anchor whack-a-mole (and they're often the easiest crisis to spawn now). I got every single anchor only to have another pop up just before reaching the portal, and that was followed quickly by another half-dozen. It was a constant ebb and flow of mass genocide and destruction, massive fleet battles and crying as millions of alloys were reduced to nothing. I wouldn't lie if I said I had almost given up, but I had been so close once that I made one massive push and reassessed my strategy. The war AI could use a bit more logic (I saw some funny behaviors) but this truly felt like a space opera upon completing this game. A great game, beautiful to watch and enjoy. Sure, the crises at the end (especially the unbidden) could use a bit more tweaking or at least be a bit more clear on how they work (because massive deathfleets that don't require resources and get insta-spawned are frustrating enough), but overall this ends up being one of the best purchases.

2971,76561198048565361,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048565361/,"Paradox Interactive has delivered an experience that I have greatly desired for a very long time. Through it's customization options, and ability to set custom empires to always spawn players can set up whatever sort of galaxy they want with in the limitations of those same customization options. Do you have a setting for a series of short stories you wrote? You can get a simulation of that up and running through Stellaris and perhaps gleam a deeper understanding of the themes explored in your work. Now in recent times the game has gotten a little more limited than it was in the early days. Warp Drives and Artificial Wormhole Generators use to be methods for FTL a civilization could start with but that has since been removed for the simplicity of Hyperdrive which was the most popular method among players when the devs decided to can the other two methods. Authority types have been simplified to Democratic, Oligarchic, Dictatorship, and Imperial. A civilization's guiding ethics have also been simplified in some regard with the ability to have an Elitist Libertarian society being null as Authoritarian and Elitist are merged as Authoritarian with Egalitarian Libertarian being merged as Egalitarian. My own personal dislike at present is the options granted to Spiritualist which don't mesh well with more peaceful and democratic routes I explore. A number of the developers are 40K fans and it shows in the references and options. They see a vast dark science fiction setting that is ancient with thousands of extinct civilizations beneath the surface and it's this darkness they like to explore. It's part of why the coding for the game has a greater chance for belligerent civilizations to spawn in your game. It's also part of why it took them a long time to create a Federation focused DLC that initially allowed for a cooperative team victory but was latter modified to grant victory to the player with the most influence in the organization. You will find yourself frustrated by the limitations of the game but are likely to find members of the community who sharing your frustration have created mods that expand your options. Even if you are frustrated you are likely to find that the customization offered here is vastly superior to any other interstellar civilization simulation/grand strategy experience on the market. After you get the game test out it's 'Custom Empire' feature, which is where I spend a lot of my time. See what you can build, make a few and start a game in a galaxy with them after setting them to 'always spawn'. After getting a feel for the game come back here and browse the Steam Workshop.

I 100% recommend looking up a DLC guide as some are really good and others are not really needed.  First DLC: Utopia and Federations add the most. Apocalypse for Deathstar gameplay. Synthetic Dawn for Robits. Distant Stars is also great for mini-events/ Lgates. The rest are more personal preference.

There's no kiddie-pool intro to Stellaris, really. You're just playing the full game right from the start, and the tutorial consists of extra tips as you open various interface windows in the UI. It's frankly overwhelming, but seems to be worth the effort. It's obviously a very rich system, even without the expansive collection of additional content for the game. I'm a fan so far, and I'd recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed civ-style games in the past. For new players to the whole 4X genre, it might be a daunting learning curve. Go play a few lighter 4X games first, or just be bold and jump into Stellaris regadless. The key surmounting the learning curve is to pay attention to the tooltips that pop up when you hover your mouse over nearly everything, Also, don't get lost in the details at first. Just keep to the basics of ensuring that you don't have idle ships, completing the tutorial missions as they pop up, and not spending too much time paused. It's easy to get lost in the weeds with this interface and spend an hour paused while you drill through options on everything. Then it's 2am and you realize you've hardly advanced the clock on the game. Don't do that.

UI can be a bit unwieldly, but there are plenty of mods to make it better. Allows for a lot of creativity, and many approaches to playing the game. The military system is my favorite feature, and is a large part of what keeps me hooked. There is a very strong snowball effect, as is the case with most 4x games, but it sorta hits all at once toward the mid-game in my experience. DLC is expensive, but it's not too bad when it's on sale. From an over all perspective of game enjoyment, you certainly don't need all of it, but Utopia Apocalypse, and Federations are great mechanics- and feature-wise, and distant stars adds more story. The other DLC entirely depends on your interest in the content, and the game is perfectly fine without them. Also, in multiplayer, everyone has access to all the DLC that the host has, so if you're here for the multiplayer you don't have to have *any*. 9/10, will probably clock a few hundred more hours.

3136,TheHornetsSting,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheHornetsSting/,"I've tried other space strategy games that on the market, however, they all seem to be confined to a linear path when you compare them to this game. Something about the seemingly infinite ways a game can go is great and the fact that you are forced to do one thing or the other is another plus. Single player is amazing as games can get you involved in the role-play aspect of your civilization before you even realize it. Mulitplayer (with friends) is even better. My friend and I (at the time of this review) have a campaign going where a swarm of nanites took out half the galaxy before the mid game even happened. Our fight for survival had never been more intense has we struggled to fight back the endless hordes as our economies tanked. Then, we became two of the four council members of what was left of the galaxy. With the empty space left behind by destroyed civilizations I began my rapid expansion until eventually we decided to bring the other two council members down to size in a complete and utter total war. The two council members tried to vote off my friend but we managed to throw political power at the senate to vote one of them off. Then they tried to denounce me but I used a veto vote to veto my own denouncement. TLDR: The game sucks you in as you begin to attach yourself to your civilization and spend hours making sure everything bends to your will. Especially when you play with friends. Please note that this is a Paradox game so it is littered with dlcs so if you aren't sure about the dlcs and have a friend that likes to play and they own the dlcs, you can just have them host a game and you don't need to the dlcs.

I really don't have much time to dive into complex games these days, but I love grand strategy games. I find this game plays more like a 4x civilization type game than a traditional RTS. There are lots of complex systems at play, and the in-game help only gives basic hints about the subjects. It says a lot about a game when they have a button on the main UI directly opening an ingame browser for the game's wiki site. As I didn't have a lot of time to put into each session, I decided to start a game on the standard difficulty - even though I made lots of newbie mistakes in the beginning the game was laughably easy. If I had more time, I would probably play it again on a higher difficulty level. As it stands, I just don't find myself interested in the game enough to justify investing more time in it. Take from that what you will, I do think it's a good game, but aside from the complexity there's just not much innovative about it. One huge negative for anyone with limited time is that the game takes forever to load, this is just completely unacceptable.

The sheer number of additions to the game over the years, the active and passionate dev team, the huge variety of mods, and the competently executed base systems make Stellaris an absolute joy to play for hours on end. The game is designed to be a pseudo-blank slate that you can endlessly customize, letting you play out virtually any fictional sci-fi space opera universe you can think of, short of absolutely absurd ones like Xeelee Sequence. Star Wars, Star Trek, Warhammer 40K, The Culture, name it you got it. You can customize not just the map, but every other species in the game, down to their inheritable (biological/mechanical) traits, ship types, government (make them pacifist hippies, make them genocidal psychopaths, make them a criminal syndicate etc) and their backstories (which influence the game drastically, such as species only living in space, apprentices to an elder race, or hive minds that are tied to a single tree on their home planet, among others). Alternatively, you can just randomize everything or some things, and play blind. The aforementioned mods increase this exponentially, with some mods on the workshop being equivalent to entire expansion packs or new games entirely. The game itself effectively has no win conditions once you start, outside the ones you make for yourself. There is technically a scoring system, but not a single souls cares about it; you don't play to win. The game revolves around making your own fun, or creating a civilization with a specific goal in mind, goals which range from militarily taking over the galaxy to uniting the galaxy diplomatically under an Emperor without firing a shot. Or you can just build megastructures everywhere, create and uplift other species, and shake your metaphorical space shotgun at other civs on your front lawn. Or anything else. I'm partial to starting on a ringworld, and never ever leaving it until the time comes to fight [REDACTED]. I have some criticisms of the game, but you must understand they are almost entirely things that only veteran players would know or care about. They won't hamper anyone's enjoyment of the game. I do have two qualifiers on my praise though; performance and DLC. Stellaris has sub-par performance, and if you have a poor CPU the game will play very slowly by the late game. You need a good one. You can also make the map smaller and reduce the number of civilizations if that's the route you want to take. Conversely, unless your GPU is absolutely terrible it will handle the game easily, as the game is not graphically intensive at all despite looking good. The DLC is another issue; Stellaris has many DLCs. I really do recommend you get all the full DLCs and the story packs to enjoy the game to the fullest, but it's not strictly necessary. Try to get them on sale, here on Steam or on Humble Bundle, with Humble in particular having amazing deals on the DLCs sometimes. It's almost universally agreed that the most important DLC is ""Utopia"", which lets you do many new things, most importantly build megastructures. The cosmetic species packs have some minor additions that are probably not worth it to a new player. That said, it sucks that there's such a steep paywall to the game, and Paradox should really discount it permanently. I can only give Stellaris my highest recommendation, easily a 9/10, held back from a full 10 due to its monetization over the years and the bad performance.",Recommended,2929.0,"3,342.2 hrs on record",Posted: 19 June

Great science fiction 4X game, it engrossed me completely, I love it. The first time I powered up Stellaris I actually went ""oooh"" while looking at all the things you need to take care of in the game (resources, construction, research, etc.). But, it all sort of clicked at once for me, and all of a sudden I understood the multiple-attention mechanics required to work Paradox games (other dox games didn't do that for me). The Stellaris tutorial bot helps fill in the details as new things arise in the game. I also like that it's science fiction, so I don't get the urge to go read a book on medieval europe or the instructions on how to play it, or etc, last thing I need from a game is something else to read. I'm using the Utopia and Ancient Relics DLCs, so I'm not entirely sure what the base game would be like. When on special add them two DLCs, that's not too expensive a game. The game has slowed down a lot lately, and there's not as much to do right now apart from infrastructure development, but hey, I'm 150 hours in and still in the middle of the glorious graph-based galactic mess that's emerged, so I'm sure someting else will happen soon.

The player can focus on the economy or on the battle-related development, the choice is yours (however, the end-game crisis still requires mighty fleets and highly advanced technologies). And the learning tree is somewhat steep: while the basics are pretty easy to grasp, you have to invest your time in learning the sofisticated in-game mechanics. Otherwise, you'll get surpirises like sudden reousrce shortages at the most unexpected moments. What's even worse, game tutorial doesn't mention such fine details at all.

I'd advise Utopia for pretty much any player regardless of playstyle, and then picking a few other DLCs that speak to your specific interests (ie, synthetic dawn for machine empires). Stellaris also has an active but somewhat disjointed modding community; since the game receives frequent updates, lots of mods break and never get updated. Really good core mods, like Gigastructures, usually stay updated on a good schedule.

But, for now, my opinion is 'solidly positive, but quickly needs mods.' The fundamental idea is that it is a 4X Grand Strategy game slowly turns from 'discover and explore space, encountering a series of exciting short stories while building up an empire' to 'epic war and diplomacy in space' to 'you must unite the galaxy against the apocalypse.' Each stage brings new challenges while building on the tools of earlier stages to add new content. Overall, it's a lot of fun. (""The Vechtar Zavonia"" is my favorite anomaly, being the best BSG riff I've ever read and then dropping a giant doom fleet on you. It's great and I love it.) The downsides are two. The first is limited content, but each new expansion adds more stuff, so that's hardy a crisis - and since each patch also changes game balance, replaying content with a new twist on it adds extra fun to the game. The second, and bigger, downside, is that the AI is a lot less skilled than an experienced and capable player. For your first sixish games, that's fine; it will take you a long time to get used to all the mechanics (I completely imploded my economy the first time the Alloys/Consumer Goods stuff came in myself), but eventually it becomes difficult to raise the difficulty high enough to be challenged. Fortunately, there's an enthusiastic modding community happy to help with this! For your later games, I (currently, as of review being written!) recommend StarTech AI with Friendship Patch. If you're really good, you can leave off the Friendship Patch, but I'm not quite that good yet myself.

Stellaris is a very REALXING and slow paced game. With the seemingly infinite possibilites, everything always stays simple, you manage your 3 basic tasks of exploration, research and construction while you are drip fed more content, and more fun, and at no stage does it ever feel like there is too much going on. Its just pure artwork how this is done, and this game, no matter how many times i start it, is always a joy to play, this game is just jam packed with INTERESTING DECISIONS, which means fun.

Initially, it can be a bit of a steep learning curve unless you're already familiar with RTS & other grand strategy style games, but once you understand the basics, the game isn't all that complicated or difficult to master. The story with the base game is good, and the DLC & story packs just add more to it in the form of random or triggered events and encounters. Replay-ability is also amazing because of this - You'll almost never get the same events or encounters on consecutive play-throughs. The soundtrack is entrancing, and I STRONGLY encourage getting it to listen to outside of when playing.

Frankly, the Star Trek mod is probably better then anything in the base game. Which is a pretty sweet thing to look forward to as a new player. Personally, I am done with deep runs of Stellaris. The mid and late game are just too boring for my taste. The designers lean too much on the Sandbox aspect of the game to keep players engaged and I have always wanted more defined lanes. Civ VI having multiple victory conditions that are clearly drawn out with their own paths and specializations appeals to me far more then trying to achievement hunt or do stuff just because its cool. Yes, I never achieved a victory as the empire of a federation but I was never given a reason to in game besides the idea that 'hey that might be cool.' The combat and how the AI handles combat, leaning into hit and run tactics, is not particularly enjoyable after the first 60 years. This feels like I'm playing Brood Wars and not Starcraft 2 in so much that everything is clunky and requires too much tedious oversight. Which, of course, is what drew me to the game in the first place. So yes, I am giving it a positive review and recommending it. I am also voicing why I'm moving on and will check back on Stellaris when new DLC hits or when a particularly juicy community mod comes out (looking at you 3.0 update to Star Wars mod). Of all my critiques, the primary one it would be great if they addressed, is that the game is just too easy to win once you are ahead. I started pumping up the Crisis to 2375 at x2 on Admiral and I was still bored by the year 2300. And maybe, I'm just not the target audience. The game is for those who know that victory is inevitable but want to RP with the AI. But when runs are 40 more hours to go and I can already tell the result, I'd rather just play something with a little more mystery or incentive.",Recommended,1609.0,381.3 hrs on record,Posted: 13 June

They've made numerous improvements to the games systems, and have also done a fairly good job of adding content that teaches the player somewhat. After the first few forays into the stellaris galaxy you find yourself learning strategies to combat everything from low resources with an economy that boosts your weaker production output, to strategic deployment of your fleets with patrolling and different defensive stances.

This means you only have to convince your friends to buy the base game. Cons: - While the base game is solid, and quite enjoyable on it's own, The Paradox way of breaking up the game into a myriad smaller expansions means you will pay a lot for them over time, even when they go on sale. - The AI is relatively dumb.

Now that we're done with that. Cons first. This game doesn't have ""good""graphics per se. It's mostly just empty void. The game has been said to be hard to get into. That's why on your first account you put everything on the easiest difficulty and just get used to the game. There are some bugs, but if you play Skyrim or Fallout 4 those are much buggier than Stellaris. Every game is different. This game is so replayable, it's almost too much to take in. I have over 250 hours in the game (and around 200 more back when Steam didn't measure game time all that well), and I haven't done nearly everything there is to do. Should I play as a species of rock seahorses that want to conquer the universe, a society of cult necroids that raise their own dead, or perhaps a species of spacefaring cat that wants to become friends with everyone? This game never gets old, and always throws in a curveball when you least expect it. Expansions. This game has a lot of expansions, and more to come. Buy all of them. Do whatever -wait till they're on sale, or if you are the kid using his daddy's money and complains about his private jet not being fast enough, just plain out buy the game and the expansions. They add a lot of content, much of which I'm unaware of. I've had the expansions Apocalypse, MegaCorp, Synthetic Dawn, Utopia, Distant Stars, and Leviathans since I've been playing Stellaris. I don't even know what the game would be like without these. They make the game playable without the dlcs, but it feels like a shell of the actual game. It's like having a delicious pizza with red pepper sprinkled on it and bacon (interchangeable with Italian sausage or chicken) and only being able to eat the crust. Yes, it's still good, but it's not the same as the pizza. Species. There are starting species to pick from, so if you don't want to create your own, you have that option. But, for those who do, there are so many possibilities. With at least over 50 species frames to pick from (idk how many there are, I'm not a creep), many traits you can pick, a good bit of Origins for your species to choose from, and a government screen that allows you to become my personal favorite, a slavery-focused dictatorship/monarchy, or the ever-classic ""democracy."" Events. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of randomly generated events that can occur. Some of these can repeat themselves, and others happen only once. These events can be game changing. Stellaris has a really good storytelling AI (AI that decides when and where to put in random events, war declaration, ect) and makes the game feel alive. 23/10",Recommended,2291.0,293.8 hrs on record,Posted: 9 June

3381,76561198068950270,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198068950270/,"Stellaris is a game that you can get sucked into for hours on end, exploring the universe and interacting with alien empires in a unique way with story elements that challenge the hypothetical questions of what would happen if the human race ever ventured into the great beyond. I bought this game not long after its release, where it started as more of a conquering the galaxy type of game, but has since evolved to become more of an empire management sort of game. It takes a short while to learn,  but will provide countless stories and fun of your adventures into the galaxy, with each play through different from the last. The DLC is admittedly - in paradox fashion - overpriced for the content it provides, so wait for sales. However if you are looking to add some spice to your game I would recommend Utopia, Distant Stars and Ancient Relics - they add interesting and exciting gameplay and story elements that you can always explore no matter which type of empire you play as. Alternatively, there are some amazing mods out there on the steam workshop, but beware some of them may require DLC's to run. Finally, a word of warning: if you have lower end computers (like what is on their recommended specs page) the game will lag heavily by the year 2300, as it often does in multiplayer sessions. While Paradox have tried to address this many times, the issue still persists. I would suggest playing on smaller galaxies, or waiting to get an upgrade for your computer.",Recommended,1213.0,731.9 hrs on record,Posted: 8 June

I must admit that version 2.0 took me a while to swallow but after I got over it, It wasn't too bad. The updates tended to mostly positive with some minor things being negative. But I feel that after Megacorp, the game became extremely unbalanced. Certain playstyles became much MUCH more powerful and since my playstyle (Isolationist Nationalist Military Empire or Religious Military Hegemony) doesn't focus too much on economy as other peaceful-semi-peaceful empires do, it suffered greatly. This have been going on for two years now and the latest update completely and utterly bricked the game with HEAVILY skewed negative changes. So unfortunately it seems that this game will finally end up on my '♥♥♥♥♥♥ Games Do Not Play' section. At a certain point I think it is important to take a look at what made the game great and actually listen to the audience. Adding features and mechanics with reckless abandon, is not something that will increase goodwill. It will only lead to certain players who play a certain way and mega-fanboys to continue supporting you. A shame really, but this new overhaul is not something I condone and unless they make a completely 180 on the last years of updates, I will never return to this game.

You can rename most things allowing you to roleplay/ create a plot for yourself which helps keep you even more interested.

I just finished my first game and was devoured by the swarm (but the game declared me the winner because all others got devoured first). You want to buy it because: You are in the mood for a big, replayable 4X space game with tons of content and mods available. You wishlisted but never bought it because: Other Paradox games you tried in the past felt unintuitive, slow and ultimately unrewarding; too many menus, too little action, UI preventing you from accessing important info; plus you can always play modded Sins of a Solar Empire or Civilization The good news: Stellaris (in its current state) feels nothing like EU or Hearts of Iron, I was able to immediately get into it without any wikis because it plays like a crossover of Sins and Civ. There's a real sense of exploration since you never know what the galaxy might hold. Plus, you can actually zoom in and watch animated space battles (great visual mods available). The ship designer is way more fun than expected and will give you a big advantage in those huge late-game fights. Verdict: Do it",Recommended,946.0,86.6 hrs on record,Posted: 5 June

The graphics were great, combat was fun, and a variety of ways to expand an empire early on in the game.  Additionally, some great mods out there, like a mod that changes everything to be Star Trek themed. What I Did Not Like The sheer amount of DLC available.  Though, all of the DLC I purchased was a decent addition to the base game, and it's not required to enjoy the base game. Also, once the galaxy map is filled up, things sorta stalled a bit.  If I played a passive empire trying to remain peaceful, it ca be fairly dull at times. Why I Stopped Playing I was super bad at the game.  My empire would be small, weak, and was hard to play in a non-conquering way. Disclaimer I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.

There's a caveats there but keep reading to find out why. Multiplayer is great in that you don't all have to have ALL the DLC. Just one person does and the rest gets to benefit so it's definitely consumer and community friendly (the amount of DLCs understandably scares people away). It's very easy to just point at any ""let's play"", but since the updates are constant it's hard to point at things within the game and provide any sort of accurate feedback. Know this, updates are constant frequent and constant and this comes with some very annoying downsides; namely, it breaks mods. I have a bunch of friends that we happily take into multiplayer; but each time there's an update, you have to stop whatever save you have (single or multi) and check what still works. Most modders get it updated and working within the week but that aside, it's annoyingly disruptive when a bigger update hits that completely changes things around.

Doesn't seem very well balanced, at least without expansion, or so I hear. The tutorial is almost entirely useless. I went countless years without it telling me how to do anything, except to navigate a handful of menus in the beginning. I've played only a handful of games. 3 were over before they began. The rest all ended in a similar manner, just taking a lot longer. Trying to build up tech and a border ai declares war and decimates me before I've even researched hardly any tech. I don't understand why they are such haters. One time I wiped the floor with one who declared war. I mean I cleared every single one of their systems and was orbital bombing their home planet like ""yeah, you messed with the wrong noob!"" And then: They became assimilated by another border ai, who promptly declared war and steamrolled me. That said, it's a good time-sink and seems like it could be fun once I figure it out. On my own, since the tutorial is utterly useless. It seems like every video I watch about playing the game reveals to me it is twice as complicated as I'd thought. You know, there is a point where that can be overdone. Just saying. This is not your average strategy game. So many more multiples more complicated. And not what I would call in a fun way. I mean, the constant windows popping up to tell me about things happening in the game alone make me want to scream and throw my monitor across the room. Leave me alone and let me play. I still might get Nemesis as it seems interesting and from what I hear is more balanced. Edit: I did get Nemesis and I've began playing tall instead of wide. I've managed to get so much further into the game and see more content. However, I've found so many  things locked behind DLC packs. Like becoming the crisis and getting a star eater ship, but can't build another star eater, because the weapons are locked behind the apocalypse DLC. Why did you give me the weapons on the ships at all if you are going to let me build another that can't use the weapons? That's shady business making you have to spend money. Plus means you have researched tech you can't even use without the DLC. Like being baited. The game is more fun now, but I also feel I'm being con'd into buying more DLC. People do tons of videos and all have the whole DLC packages, and that's like $200 almost. Why would you pay $200 for a game? Insane.",Not Recommended,1991.0,162.7 hrs on record,Posted: 3 June

Stellaris focuses primarily on the story of your civilization, allowing you to become anything from the Idyllic leader of a galactic federation to a race of robots bent on cleansing the galaxy of all organics. I love how variable this game is, with every aspect from your species to your empire’s values and policies to what other empires will populate the galaxy with you. That being said, there are a couple of problems that some people might have with the game. First, if you don’t enjoy figuring out how to play the game, it can be discouraging when you first start. There is a tutorial, but it only really helps with the basics, and you do have to figure out a good bit of it on your own. I personally enjoyed discovering all that there is to the game, but I know that not everyone wants to deal with that. Second, there is quite a lot of DLC, and buying the full game might be a bit much for some people. The DLC adds a lot to the game, but you could easily end up sending an extra $200 dollars on it if you buy the full set. They do sales fairly regularly though, so if you’re patient, you should be able to get the price down considerably. Those issues aside, this game is very enjoyable, and has already given me over 500 hours of entertainment, and the continued effort of the development team means that I am likely to continue to find more to enjoy in it in the future. Overall, I would suggest this game to anyone who likes grand strategy or story driven games.",Recommended,2217.0,618.9 hrs on record,Posted: 3 June

It is deep, strategic, with the emotion of exploring the stars and building a civilization that I did not have since Galactic Civilizations (one and two). Stellaris is much better of course, given how old that game is now. Although less important to me, it also has great graphics, music and sound effects. You cannot control almost anything during the battle. At first I thought that was a limitation, coming from Sins of a solar empire, but now I like it because the fun is being able to build the fleets and defenses, and to decide where to employ them.

3552,jmdrak,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jmdrak/,"I wouldn't recommend this because I'm not smart enough to run a galaxy and I don't find my ignorance entertaining. There's just...SO MUCH. So many systems, some highly relevant, some mostly irrelevant, none of them user-friendly. It doesn't help that the tutorial is awful, which is apparently par for the course for this developer. There's something like fourteen different raw resources to keep track of, and that's not including the non-obvious stuff like population growth, administrative capacity, and your empire's political parties. I'm struggling to explain how complicated things are, so I'll just tell a little story. I created a race of philosopher roaches, and in exploring the galaxy I found one empire that wanted to be ignored, one empire that wanted to trade, and one that wanted to fight me. My war against the third group was slowed somewhat by the fact that although attack ships only cost alloys to build, armies to invade planets cost population, must be built on a planet, and take forever to move out to the warfront. I had used some of my 'influence' resource to lay claim to one of my enemy's systems, but I couldn't afford to lay claim to any more, and so I fought a war across five systems to end up winning control of only one. All of this took about six real-time hours, spanning about 35 in-game years (out of 300 for the standard game). The whole time you are being spammed with survey results, anomaly research options, three tech trees that are semi-randomized, construction tasks, planet development management, and leader selection. If I were an immortal being with nothing but time on my hands, I'd sink the hundred-odd hours into learning this game that it demands. As it stands, the game makes me feel like the galaxy's most incompetent god-emperor.

EUIV had a good run going, but a string of questionable DLC releases and updates culminated in the disastrous Leviathan, which was such a catastrophe that it kind of disqualifies the game from this race. HOIV is really polished and fun in some ways, but lacking in depth and substance in a number of key areas. CK3 is good and has potential to be great, but as a relatively new game it lacks the depth of content of the more mature titles. VIC3 could be the promised one ... who knows. I played a bit of Stellaris when it was new, and really liked it, but got bored of it after a few runs. It reminded me of where CK3 is right now... good game, lot of potential, but just not enough there to keep me interested in multiple long playthroughs. Recently grabbed all the DLC except Nemesis (another new and poorly-received PDX DLC in a worrying trend) and booted it up again. Im sure there are jaded vets who have poured in 500 or 1000 + hours and can only see the flaws and shortcomings of the game. That happens with every good game, and Im not saying that this game has no flaws, because it does. But ultimately I think Stellaris is a masterpiece of the genre at this point, even with all the room for improvement it still has. There is so much game here, and so many ways to play it. It has a fairly steep learning curve as all PDX grand strategy games do, but its actually pretty easy to just pick up and figure out enough on the fly to keep your initial forays into galactic domination interesting, even when you are getting stomped by a bunch of xenophobic space turtles.",Recommended,1347.0,344.0 hrs on record,Posted: 29 May

The options in the game for how you want to rule your empire and the large playsets you can experience are incredible in Stellaris. The mods for the game also supplement the DLCs for the game and allow you to do much more than just the base game if you look at ""collections"" in the steam workshop.

The game is extremely in depth and goes beyond the scope for most strategy games. You'll be manipulating international politics as well as domestic politics. Factions spring forth from your empire, with different desires, and you'll need their favor.. These factions have different values they uphold, and the closer you align the more they support. Those ethics could conflict with the rest of your empire. The ethical nature of multiple empires is incredible. Will you enslave races? Are you authoritarian? Are you democratic? Are you spiritual? Empires are a mix of a multitude of different ideas and it will affect how they act and govern. There is a galactic senate where new laws for the galaxy will be passed, which can conflict with these ideals. What really makes Stellaris great are these mini random stories that pop up. You'll have choices on how they play out and they're spread out throughout the game. It makes it feel like this huge wide sprawling story of crazy conflicts. It's just amazing when these events happen that just change up everything. For instance at the end of my game, there was a unique crisis that occured that was so threatening that all the nations in the galaxy united together to stop it.

While it still has its issues (mostly nitpicks and personal annoyances really) this is one of those 4x games I come back to consistently, usually to try something stupid as the game is relatively easy once you've gotten used to the mechanics and how the AI works. Even with the amount of DLC it has I'd say its at least worth a try, if you like it get the DLC!

Does a good job making you feel like you're cobbling together an empire in a galaxy teeming with other species doing the same. Interacting with other empires is the highlight - send an envoy to figure out how to communicate with the race of sentient fungi that you've discovered just outside your border. Perhaps they will reciprocate the effort... perhaps behind the stench and awkward first moments they have the same core values you do, and what begins as a friendly trade arrangement blossoms into a friendship, a federation and a destiny ruling the stars side by side, human and fungi. Or perhaps after mistaking your attempts at communication as a challenge they abduct and murder the scientist you send to speak with them, and invade. Game isn't perfect though. UI is truly horrible and clunky. Ship models are cool but combat looks silly and cartoonish. Also expect a few doomed runs until you figure out the basic mechanics the game doesn't explain.

The game is also a MASSIVE Time sink as many core tasks take a while to complete and more so those that have several tiers or stages to them.

RTS style definitely feels better than a turn based game such as Civ 5. Multiplayer works well. HOWEVER. I'm not recommending this due to the expensive, critical DLC that doesn't go on enough of a sale. At this point to get the proper experience you need to drop $50-$100 on top of the base game - which they still ask $40 for. Even when the DLC does go on sale, it's still $10. If the the oldest DLC went to $5-7.50 when on sale I'd be OK with it. But 4 year old DLC that's still $20 and doesn't go on sale for under $10? It's a hard pass.

The game does not have a victory animation or anything, once the victory year comes and you're the top player, you just get the leader board and that's it. 2.

The basic premise of ""Civilization, but in space, and in the endgame, a doomsday army appears to wipe out all life"" hooked me instantly. By that point in the game, no other society can contend with you, and a final battle between you and some ancient life eradicating horrors is exactly what I wanted. Except I spent almost a thousand hours trying to contrive a scenario to actually have an exciting final battle. In the overwhelming majority of games, I find myself sitting idle for hours in an already conquered galaxy, waiting for the crisis to start. The game mechanics are clunky, and they've pushed so many updates that QOL improvements are desperately needed. The AI manages planets terribly, which means TONS of tedious micromanaging.

It has countless systems that you can do a deep dive into. The mini-stories and events are always good for a read if you have the time and aren't rushing. The added expansions are highly recommended because of the optimizations and new features(except the species packs) but even the base game is a good starting point if you are just getting into Grand Strategy. The only flaw I can think about is the optimization. This game runs like A** after a few hours in. It has issues using the full power of your computer as well as running a million-ish calculations every second which results in a massive drop in the ingame time the further the year gets. Highly recommended you only get this if you have a mid-high PC and are willing to maybe get some of the workshop mods to optimize the gameplay and even then only if you are patient and don't mind your game going from 100% speed to 50%.

It is super exciting when you first get into it. The feeling of ""just one more turn"" definitely hits. You can play it again and again, and never end up playing through the same game twice. It doesn't hold your hand. You can spend 100's of hours in a single game, building everything up, and if you make a single mistake, the enemy AI will catch it and use it against you. Now some bad stuff: Most of features or what makes this game unique, is locked behind DLC. Being part of a federation is boring without the DLC. Without Utopia DLC, there is only 1 mega structure available. Without another DLC, being part of the galactic community is almost worthless. The game is not fully unlocked by base game alone, and its very evident when you are 30-50 hours in.

4043,76561198870618688,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198870618688/,"This game is great, and I mean great. I picked it up on Xbox when it released and it's been on of the few games I'll play regularly and predictably. This is also largely because of the modding community it has cultured, from Nexus, and even the workshop there are plenty of mods to check out. The only downside about this game is that the game itself is kinda boring and slow without mods, and not many mod managers support this game meaning you have to manually download mods not within the steam workshop into the Paradox launcher. Which everyone knows at this point is a pain in the ass to do. Mods I would highly recommend are Giga-structures, more events, a UI mod, and a galaxy graphics enhancer mod just to name a few. There's a really cool Elven mod, a Mass Effect mod, a Halo Mod, a Destiny Mod, and even Star Wars mods; but this review isn't about mods. The gameplay is nice and decent, it feels like a lot in the beginning but doesn't start to get overwhelming until you have a few colonies under your belt. The complexity of it has turned off a lot of people, especially my friend who I recommended the game to. From an unnecessarily complex UI, to confusing empire management policies and stuff it can be overwhelming for new players. In most respects it will be like a Dark Souls game, your first couple runs will not be perfect, they will be challenging and you will fail; but will be rewarding when you get an empire going that is able to compete with others. A key feature of the game is designing your own empire and even species to create a galactic conqueror, pacifist, defender, liberator or even a democratic crusader. From Megacorp, hivemind, to SKYNET machine intelligence, the possibility is really endless when you get to it. It gives players a lot of control which is probably why I love this game. At times I can create the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crazy Empire and the most realistic, roleplay empire I've ever done with descriptions upon descriptions. This is only improved upon by origins, which set up the game for you in ways that are really good or really bad. Mid game (From 2300 to 2400) is where the game gets boring for me though, as a majority of this time of the game is spent preparing for the end game, but I've had games where I've spawned in a galaxy full of Xenophobes or Xenophiles (While being the opposite) and it was war throughout the entire midgame, which can be fun and can pass the time. Your first end game crisis is the most memorable. I had the Unbidden but beat them relatively easily, made the mistake of turning the crisis up to 25x and fighting the Scourge on my next play-through. I lost faster than your father did custody of you when he left. But as every player knows this game can only be good for so long. I've probably invested hundreds of hours on my Xbox, but every single playthrough is an investment of time. On average 5-10 hours per full run, which gets boring without friends. Thankfully the modding community is pretty active and constantly developing new mods, which can offset the stagnation of this game to some extent. This game also experiences a slow decline in game speed, which I can understand, but sometimes it gets to the point where a single day is one second; turning two months into a single minute which makes the game drag on (especially when constructing mega projects with the length of decades). Give or take, a single year turns into five minutes, and it takes 23 years (with all the mega-structure bonuses in the game, I added it up) to build a ring world. Basically two hours to build one ring world at end game speeds. Now it could just be that my ram is not enough, but if that's the case 4 GBs of ram is not the minimum for 1080p gameplay, it's more like six or eight. The music is alright, there's a few good songs but it always has a weird techno/disco type of rhyme to it that kind of makes it feel like supermarket music than gameplay music. Like my friend who also like this game makes a lot of jokes about the music, you just gotta be in the right mood to tolerate it. Even then I just listen to my own music in the background. But yeah, this game is great, it's fabulous with mods too.",Recommended,3408.0,90.1 hrs on record,Posted: 16 May

It'd be one thing if they just sold it that way, but they don't. They'd rather you buy a game over and over again instead of just putting it all in one honest sell. Biggest problem with the game itself is recent updates. Gameplay can turn into a real slog. Without getting to in the weeds, let's just say mid to late game makes it extremely tedious to gain new populations. And EVERYTHING in Stellaris runs on populations. It gets to feeling like actual work instead of fun, rewarding gameplay.

Cons Steep and long learning curve Lots of content gated behind expansions making the full game a lot more expensive some of the older content is a little dated/weak (Hive Minds)Very deep strategy game in its current form. My Experience. I played this some around release and got bored pretty quickly but it has had several years of content added, incremental improvements since then. First off I want to say that I enjoy the game and consider it the best Successor to the old Master of Orion games.  That said it is quite a bit different, balancing and optimizing your economy is much more complicated, expanding (either through wars, or outposts, costs influence putting a cap and how much and how quickly you can expand or conquer (meaning a lot of times even if you can crush your opponent you can't take all of their stuff quickly or at once).  I found even on very low difficulty settings I benefited  a lot from using console codes(cheats) on my first playthrough just to get a handle on the different systems and how they interact (not having enough resources stashed ahead of time for big building projects, not understanding how to prioritize and balance jobs, picking an origin that doesn't make you painfully weak, not getting wiped out by the four alien empires that all found me, developed genocidal hatred of me, and attacked me at the same time early on).  I had to look up a fair number of youtube videos help pages and wiki entries to figure out how to do a lot of stuff (getting certain techs and perks to unlock by getting their preques, or understanding the claim system which I thought was something totally different, or dealing with wars and war exhaustion).

A new map with every start. I've even seen Sol system a few times, but the system only consisted of up to 4 planets, sometimes none are habitable. I've wanted this game for years, and it did not disappoint. Most RTS games only offer a single storyline that you must follow, unless you play an open campaign, which is very limited. Stellaris is completely open, you build your own story, so no constraints. Lots of races, and the DLCs add a few more (I prefer playing as machines, as I don't like humans, and am sure that other living organisms would be just as inhumane). DLCs also add so much more to game play and content.

Paradox pricing is ridiculous, it puts you in a hard spot to really really decide if you want to play and love a game, since in the end it will pull money out of your pocket again and again and again (and in a big amount). No, i will not support this. I ask everybody to just expand the ""content for this game"" part and tell me honestly this is perfectly OK.

4129,76561198166652326,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198166652326/,"Where to begin... For me this is, first of all, a roleplay game, even more than it is a 4x strategy game. I would spend hours only on the empire creation screen, where you can choose A LOT of your empire custom traits (even the genome of your primary species!). For better understandment of the rpg side, here's a list of some of my Empires: - An empire ruled by a caste of telepathic stone mummies, made from elements of the lower classes - A democracy of superintelligent lazy moles, so lazy that they invented robotics in the middle ages in order not to do menial tasks - literally GLaDOS - The USSP, Union of Socialist Soviet Planets All this empires play mechanically different, so it's not only about flavor. Given that, and the random generation of the map and of the events in every playthrough, we can approximatively say this game has infinite replayability (some time you have to let it ""cool down"" for a bit though). I also find it more like a really complex (in a good sense) tabletop game, than like an rts. After all, most of what you do is watch numbers (resources, population, fleet power, political power, modifiers, etc..), and take decisions. So, if you like Sci-fi and would role-play as some intergalactic emperor, this game is made for you. (Not suprisingly, at least half of the community is composed of Warhammer 40K hardcore fans) Nevertheless, this game is, as I said, about watching numbers, so, if you are an economy enthusiast you'll find it pretty good too. And if you liked the last phase of SPORE, why havn't you bought this already? Now let's speak about the objective (not ""I don't like the genre"") PROBLEMS: - There isn't a real tutorial (only some hint box), and, oh boy, does this need a tutorial! There is though a complete description of everything (statistic, modifier etc.. ) if you hover the mous over it. Either you ""study"" that, or you look on YouTube. - End game lag: I only experience it using my laptop, which comes from the far gone 2015, but I hear it's a common problem. It can slow down the endgame, making a day (normally 1 (game)day/second) last even 3 seconds. It gets better if you use smaller galaxies. - Language Translation: I'm italian, and there's no italian translation. For me it wouldn't be a problem, but I have friends that would appreciate this game if it was in their mother tongue. I know that for somewhat reason Italy is often seen as some backwater republic by some other states, but we're literally like France and Spain, with the difference that we make Pizza. So why French and Spanish and not Italian? - Finally, the big one, DLCs: To experience the full game you have to pay EA style. I really like this game, so it wasn't that much of a problem for me, but i agree that it's not ideal, and it's kinda stupid. I will say though that it is actually a similar policy to World of Warcraft, and people are kinda ok with that one. The advice I can give is that there are only 3 DLCs that I think are definitely necessary: Utopia, Distant Stars and Ancient Relics. (it kinda depends on you, but you definitely need at least Utopia) It would make definitely more sense if the base game was free to play, because it would definitely draw more customers. But, in this real world, the only thing I can say is: all hail steam sales!",Recommended,2700.0,447.5 hrs on record,Posted: 13 May

Lots of mix and match possibilities to create diverse empires with varying government archetypes and ethics! Play as a Militarist Fanatic Egalitarian Democracy and liberate empires with opposing ethics or play as an Authoritarian Dictatorship and enslave the other empires species. You can even play as a Fanatical Purifier and purify the galaxy of all inferior life forms! The game has many control panels for your empire one example being policies. The policies have a primary effect but the nature of the policy can affect your populations in positive or negative manners depending on your empires ethics. For example egalitarian populations have their happiness lowered if there are policies that allow slavery and the reverse holds true for authoritarian populations. Or if you dislike your populations having free thought you can play as a hive mind or machine empire and ignore mechanics like population happiness and ethics.

My recommendation: Avoid seeking too much advice from other players. There is an excellent wiki for raw information. But the opinions of experienced players will usually just make you feel like you're playing the game wrong, or paralyze you with confusion. But it's better to just charge forward and learn for the next time. The truth is, the game is pretty forgiving, in that you can play a good game without even being aware of all the mechanics, let alone understanding what's optimal. Gaining deeper and deeper knowledge of the game is more rewarding when it's more natural. Otherwise it's just overwhelming. As for DLC, the model seems predatory at first. I don't have all the DLCs, and can't speak to all their qualities. But the more I play the game, the more I appreciate and even crave what they offer.

I accidentally committed genocide. Against my only major diplomatic ally. A race of anarcho capitalist foxes closed their borders to me and seemingly destroyed one of my ships in the process. Responding proportionally, I took half their empire's systems, and mass enslaved their people. Made peace with them when I felt I had been properly compensated.

Whether I'm attacking or defending doesn't seem to matter. The ships I lose relatively to my opponents will matter, but only in their favor, rarely in mine. It's like playing chess, but all of the pieces look like pawns, and they just move randomly when you touch them.

That's why this game is so damn good.",Recommended,932.0,262.1 hrs on record,Posted: 5 May

4352,Incendium000,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Incendium000/,"Stellaris is an excellent experience due to the combination of base game mechanics and the modding community - albeit it isn't perfect in some ways. You see the problem with Stellaris isn't a major gameplay mechanic, but rather the way those mechanics are implemented, or rather locked, behind DLC. Stellaris has many, many pieces of DLC, and many of the game's best and most in-depth mechanics are in those pieces of DLC. For example, the easiest type of nation to play - a Machine Intelligence - is locked behind the Synthetic Dawn DLC. This means that newer players will be forced into a more difficult experience due to Paradox's DLC problems. However, if you can get past the DLC problems then Stellaris is a grand strategy experience like almost no other. I do consider Stellaris the best among Paradox's mainline titles, and is a very different experience from Paradox's mainline games, which are historical simulations such as Crusader Kings or Hearts of Iron. You see, Stellaris is a game that allows for a level of customization unmatched in any Paradox title; if you want to play the Imperium of Man, you can - or you can play the United Federation of Planets, or any other scifi trope you'd like. In addition, the extensive modding community gives the game a level or personalization that is once again unrivalled - and Modding is even supported by Paradox! It's quite simple to install and use mods [albeit they can cause multiplayer issues]. However, the best mechanics are once again locked behind DLC paywalls, which is quite unfortunate considering that those mechanics take this game to the next level. In my personal opinion, base game Stellaris is a good experience, but full DLC Stellaris is the best Grand Strategy experience one can buy... if it didn't cost nearly 300 dollars for that full experience. I'd recommend Stellaris to someone who is willing to put out a little more cash for it [or is able to wait until a sale], but the base game itself is still quite good.",Recommended,1650.0,996.3 hrs on record,Posted: 5 May

4356,76561198049172817,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049172817/,"TL;DR: Stellaris is the deepest (but accessible) 4X/RTS narrative sandbox I have ever seen. It's great and runs wonderfully on Linux! I spent so many hours in Stellaris and I'll probably spend much more in the future. I just can't get bored of it. The reason is that even after almost 500 hours, I still discover new things. Stellaris is deep, very deep! You can customize your species, your ships, your politics, your economy, etc. But fortunately, you don't have to understand any of these to enjoy it. In your first runs you will probably enjoy the usual 4X elements. You'll take one of the many default species, colonize planets, build fleets, do diplomacy and war (a lot of wars!). But you will notice that Stellaris has a lot of side stories: every system has something special to discover with often choices you have to make. I was really amazed by how much narration they put into the game. Stellaris is not about winning or losing, it is about exploring Space (and making war!). There are even special events that really looks more like bosses than outperforming other players. In your following runs, you'll probably discover how to manage your economy. In the following you will try to customize your ships. Then, if you are like me, after 100 hours in the game you'll discover the politics window: decide if you want to enslave your people or make them as happy as you can. You can set the rights of any species in your empire. You can play as the most xenophile specie, or the most xenophobic, as spiritualist or materialists, as pacifists or militarists. It's almost an RPG game at that level! And the music is great too! So what is Stellaris. It's a sandbox in Space. It lets you play the way you want (but forces you a bit to do war ;) ). I don't play Stellaris to win, but exploring the huge space is fun, reading the story of every event.",Recommended,1522.0,729.7 hrs on record,Posted: 5 May

It feels kinda like Sins of a Solar Empire but much more satisfying. The premise is simple - Start off in one star system, expand, build, make contact with aliens, fight them or make friends, keep expanding your territory, etc. Where this game differs from other civ-building games though is where it really adds an extra dimension to the genre - at the endgame phase all hell will break loose and you'll be scrambling to survive the coming apocalypse. It's a thoroughly tense and gripping experience. The base game itself is rather bland, although still engaging and fun, so you're gonna need at least a couple of expansions to flesh out the experience. If you can't afford the DLC then fear not - the workshop content is brilliant and includes a crazy amount of mods from your favourite sci-fi franchises (Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, etc) which should keep you entertained for days on end. The Star Trek mod is my personal favourite, highly recommended. Overall, this is a deep and rich galactic strategy experience which I highly recommend. The only negative point is the pricing model, which sadly has become a common drawback of Paradox games. Still, if you wait for a sale you can get the expansions fairly cheaply and supplement this with plenty of workshop content. 9/10 - Utterly brilliant and satisfying galactic grand strategy experience",Recommended,1195.0,120.2 hrs on record,Posted: 5 May

The DLC Expansions are ideally needed to get the full experience as many are needed for mid/late game to fuel the empire, but with careful resource management, it should be possible without them; just more challenging.

4453,76561197971252326,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971252326/,"tl;dr It's an excellent 4x style game, but WAY too complicated.  It's very fun and very engaging, BUT the learning curve is high and there's so much detail in the game that honestly it's overwhelming on your first play through and parts of it start to feel more tedious than fun.  Some of the things also don't work that well unfortunately. pros Looks great Super detailed - you can actually watch the space battles and zoom in on them. Insane amounts of depth Runs smoothly Game play is quite fun cons The game doesn't give you an easy way to figure out how to play.  There's a ""helper"" but it doesn't help too much in explaining things. It tries but a lot of times it's not enough.  I learned a lot by thinking ""this is dumb there's gotta be a way to do this, right?"" and looking it up. The ""helper"" covers up a valuable menu.  I left the helper's message up there in case I needed to read it later and didn't realize it covered up one of the most important menus. The need to tell you about the ""M"" button early.  I don't know if they did and I missed it but when a friend told me about it, it changed everything. The way the jobs/resources works is very confusing.  You'll be +20 energy and then suddenly -10.  You build more energy generators and you goto... -15.  You build more and you go to -18.  Then you give up and then next thing you notice, you're at +25. Diplomacy is kind of b.s. in the game.  My two neighbors were really aggressive against me.  One I got, because they were like zealot types. The other was a peaceful trader type, yet they attacked me.  Also you'll notice empires acting really weird.  I'm far from certain empires and they'll close their borders to me even tho... I'm not anywhere near close enough for that to matter.  You'll see empires declare they will protect another empire only for them to say ""nevermind"" 3 days later. Gaining territory from others is a bit confusing.  If you're a certain set up you can just take over places.  If not then you have to declare war and then take it over and then make a claim to it.  But that only works for some people if you're the one being attacked, because you can't make claims in an aggressive war.  But then you do have an option of asking them to be your vassal and if they refuse you can start a war to make them a vassal and then you can integrate them in.  I JUST found that out 33 hours into the game. Sometimes it just feels like a lot of tedious work.  Like I never care about the leaders (they'll constantly die due to old age) and factions because it gets so into nitty gritty that it gets annoying.",Recommended,2083.0,42.8 hrs on record,Posted: 2 May

I have around 800 games on different platforms and it is very hard to show me anything new, but this game constantly surprises me in many aspects. It absolutely and tremendously scratches my itch to play 4X strategy games. Customization options galore When you start a New Game you are presented with a huge array of options to start with. With these tools at your disposal, you can truly always make a difference when starting out to conquer the galaxy. Government Whether you are a Machine exterminating the whole galaxy fixing the undoing of your creators, a Fanatic Pacifist and Xenophile conspirating with your peers in a federation against it or just an Authoritarian Militarist Xenophobe who is sitting back and watching it unfold, then stabbing them in the back, you will find that your people might change their views on your actions and form factions to hinder you or help you in your agenda. Except for Machines, they are not really into petty politicking. Planets as backbones You start out on a Desert planet, beset by sandstorms and constant problems of growing your population. You do what you can, then 100 years pass or 200 and you can terraform other planets that are undesirable but huge with many Districts to populate and buildings to erect. Soon you'll be... Churning out Fleets Whether you are fending off attackers or warring with other nations or just protecting your trade routes, you will need fleets to keep peace. Either by warring against others to protect what you have or repelling those that oppose your mighty churches.

4477,76561198957257911,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198957257911/,"Pros: 1. Exploration at the beginning of the game is one of the best parts of the game. It's probably the most seamless, streamlined and enjoyable period of the game. Thanks to updates by paradox there is now a large amount of anomalies and excavation sites to explore at the start of the game, which makes exploration quite diverse and fun even after you've put in 100's of hours. 2. Managing planets as a big part of the game. Some may not see this as a pro, however for me managing planets makes me feel closer to the empire I'm managing and I like the challenge it provides. Managing planets gives you a large amount of control over how your empire runs and I think that taking control and changing an empire because of your actions is what grand strategy games are all about. 3. Epic music. The stellaris soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a video game, the soundtrack complements the game perfectly, not much else to say here. cons: 1. Late game lag. Unless your running stellaris on one of NASA's computers your going to experience lag towards the end of the game. You can mitigate this somewhat by playing on smaller galaxies or reducing the number of planets that spawn in a galaxy. 2. The mid game can be a bit dry. The mid game is the most boring part of the game nothing much really happens unless you make something happen. There isn't really any exploration and the crisis only comes in at late game, megastructures become available in the mid game, but despite that it's still pretty boring. Overall I'd recommend stellaris it has some flaws but you can easily put a couple 100 hours into it.",Recommended,1322.0,278.9 hrs on record,Posted: 2 May

If you enjoy Master of Orion, Galactic Civilizations, or any grand sweeping 4X space game like that, then Stellaris is the apotheosis of that genre. It does all the things you love about the games that came before, and adds a dizzying array of additions both in the races you can play as and against, as well as in the mechanics of the game. You can build megastructures like Ring Worlds and Dyson spheres; unite the galaxy under a flag of peace or tyranny; fight wars with gods and defeat robot uprisings bent on eradicating all life. Every play through is different, and after every one if you were to describe all the cool stuff that had happened you would have described a setting for an amazing science fiction series and tales of victory and defeat that feel deeply personal despite being procedural generated.

And then you realize that the AI-empires are at that point in time still literally pathetic in fleet power. And then you realize that the AI-empires ignore the Unbidden even if they are cutting their way through their own territory. And then you realize that the Unbidden somehow teleported a fleet into your home territory. And then you realize that when your own fleets will reach the Unbidden they will have received so many reinforcements that you cannot beat them anymore. Now I know the real use of Fallen Empires.

Especially 3.0 introduced new things that are broken. But some things that I would consider a core feature, like the endgame crisis, are also laughably buggy even before patch 3.0 arrived. The AI of both the normal AI factions, as well as of the Crisis factions at some point simply stops playing (around 100-200 years into the game) and does not do *anything* anymore, not even move their fleets. This is no minor issue. This is game-breaking. Other than that its' kind of a mixed bag. The eco management is fun. The wars are really bad. If you play this game for war, you will be disappointed.

There is tedium to the game, but you can also choose to automate over micromanage. I love the replayability of the game.  Whether it is a different map, different species, different goals - there are a lot of reasons to start a new game. I love the graphics and fluidity of the game.  It is well done, aesthetically nice and pleasing, with very smooth graphics.  The different species are creative and ingenious. The game can be expansive if you wish - a small empire in a sea of empires, or you can shrink your galaxy to fit just a few.  Please the huge galaxy and you may be in for a 100-200 hour game. The developers are constantly refining the mechanics of the game to add more diversity and realism to the experience. I would say the cons have more to do with your style.

4664,TheSgtNoob,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSgtNoob/,"TLDR; if you have money and time to burn this game is worth it (steam sales only will run you about $120 depending on how many DLCs you want) If you like RTS, the base game is worth the $30 (steam sale no DLC) All ""good"" DLC, even with steam sales bumps the price to $120 (including base game) even with steam sales As you play you will be tempted to buy the DLC since the base game shows but doesn't allow player interaction with certain DLC related items (but the base game doesn't hide items behind the paywalls) If you are cheap then don't buy this game and probably ignore any paradox interactive games unless you have money to burn. In terms of ""fun"" you can easily waste weeks of time on this game and it feels like you never have quite enough time to play (like civilization's ""just one more turn"" feeling) Paradox does update the game for free but note the base game receives the absolute minimum of updates so if you decide to buy DLC  it doesn't just blow you out of the water. If you like achievement hunting PASS this game as the majority of achievements require DLC content and there is a lot of DLC. Never tried multiplayer, so couldn't tell you about that. The AI is not particularly smart as the AI doesn't seem to understand how to use DLC content unless you drag the game on for awhile or gift it resources on normal or hard difficulty. Protip: Ironman mode sounds tough but all it really does is make ""save scumming"" for cheating in games harder so if you are a player who doesn't care for always winning or you want to get achievements then play with ironman mode ON Additional Protip: Play on small or medium galaxy size in your first game or two in order to determine if your computer with YOUR playstyle can handle the requirements of late game Stellaris. My computer starts chugging on large galaxy size especially if the Utopia DLC is enabled as that allows ""build your own planets"" and the AI loves them in the mid-to-late game if the galaxy has been more or less peaceful",Recommended,1628.0,487.5 hrs on record,Posted: 27 April

Good luck figuring that out, the tutorial is weak and explains nothing on a grand scale,  just what minor things are. You have to put those together to make some formula that equates to an empire or something. The best way to learn is watch videos of people playing,  but good luck there too... there are different versions of the game. So you maybe just watch an hour long video learning the details of growing an empire to realize it was for a previous version. So you watch a new video to get up to speed, log in and try your new skills... but wait,  stop, the devs release a new version that changes core mechanics of the game. Forget what you learned and relearned. So you watch a video that explains the new big  '♥♥♥♥' update and learn the mechanics all over again. You log into the game to try your new skill and you see a Dev post saying they are going to tweak the mechanics for pop growth due to the outrage of the community in a new patch.  Did I just have a stroke? did I read that correctly? I have to watch a new video again? so while I have only so many hours playing the game, I have so many more hours reading the fourms, wandering through the wiki, and watching 'let's play campaigns. Steam should count those hours. So it is a fun game and I play it now mostly with mods for the sake of my sanity and health concerns.

I tried other games by Paradox and never really liked it.  My friends bought this for me, so I felt compelled to give it a fair shake. This game is truly immense.  Perhaps not as in-depth as some old-school text based stuff, but as far as RTS goes, its outrageous.  If you're thinking about buying it, I'd recommend waiting for a sale on the base game, playing a pre-made civ, and utilizing the speed controls and the pause function.  You will be overwhelmed, and while it never gets less complicated, you will get used to it.  At time of writing, I have over 400 hours into this game (realistically, something like 300 because i've fallen asleep to it's GORGEOUS SOUNDTRACK) and I have never completed a game.  Not because I couldn't, but by the time I feel like I could beat it, I want to try different memes. Ultimately, that's what this game comes down to: galactic-scale, immense, over-the-top memes with gorgeous everything. 8.5/10  play w/ friends or solo, both are great.  if you only like fast-paced games, this won't change your mind much.  it's enjoyable, but probably only for power-nerds",Recommended,952.0,480.7 hrs on record,Posted: 26 April

4703,fishstuff,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fishstuff/,"I can play this game for 4 hours straight (my 20 hours thus far are from 4-5 sessions). Stellaris is a combination of Crusader Kings and Galactic Civilisations: you have ultra-aggressive expansionism/imperialism from galactic empires, with vassals, galactic sprawl (how many entities you control, going over limit gives debuffs) and the player playing as a ruler instead of an immortal being ruling over each civilisation indefinitely. Gameplay wise, the game is mostly about balancing different focuses, a surprisingly challenging thing to do, especially considering the majority of games are against ai. For example, with a xenophile civilisation the player is encouraged to be diplomatic and seek alliances, while waging war on them is discouraged. This means more research is spent on diplomacy than weapons. Conversely, a xenophobe civilisation would be actively invading other civilisations, which means researching weapons more. For both of these 'main' (I'm not actually sure if these are main stream; I only have 20 hours played), the player must also balance how much resources are spent developing industry to produce more resources with how much resources are spent making research faster. The AI in this game are usually somewhat logical: they don't declare war on nations that have navies 2-3x bigger than theirs, larger powers actively invade smaller nations, and independent systems or very small nations will seek diplomatic relations with larger powers for protection These mechanics seem complicated (there are actually more things to be doing, the above was a basic list), which is, personally, the best part of the game. When you inevitably fail, you know that the main cause is some flaw in your strategy or the balance you were maintaining, and I find it satisfying to fix those flaws (?).",Recommended,1526.0,46.1 hrs on record,Posted: 26 April

Despite having conquered every system, reducing their fleets and planets to ashes, there is no way I can push my wargoal through. E.g. the negative -100 (vassalization) or the ""forced to surrender"" modifier, giving you another -100 modifier for them to accept your peace offer that is completely ridiculous and makes it rather difficult to accomplish anything with that wargoal or - for instance, make the AI accept that wargoal. This has happened to me TWICE IN A ROW. I am aware that it's called ""over time"" for a reason and that the AI gets it too, this mechanic has a sense and it's not an useless mechanic at all. Yet I don't get the point why I'm having more attrition and I, the one who is totally winning the war, is forced by THEM to peace out OR forced by them to carry on the war because they wouldn't accept the wargoal (for mentioned negative modifiers like the vassalization one) - thus resulting in said scenario. Because apparently, I reached 100 Attrition faster with my empire totally untouched by war and everyone being militaristic. I honestly wish for them to add in more modifiers contributing to the wargoal / war like ""defeated"" and being defeated in space battles also having a much bigger impact on the overall warscore and the attrition, radically improving the chances of pushing through your wargoal or atleast give THEM the chance to make peace or, as a result, make THEM get attrition for their stubborness. Alot of attrition. I don't think their population would try to keep the war going when all planets are occupied, destroyed and your fleets no longer existing. Unlike your population that is apparently absolutely fed up with it - even though you're winning it and your entire population is xenphobic + militaristic, actually making their fervor for winning this war even bigger yet on the side demanding you to peace out (?). Don't get me wrong though. Despite this rather minor, yet annoying problem, that perhaps a few more people share, I like this game and it's really fun.

Its a punishing game to start.. and there is a lot of navigation/building systems which dont feel natural or instinctive to work out. Some of my less gamer friends spent the first hour zoomed in and moving ships outside galaxy mode lol The game has so many layers to it, its easy to  get lost in all the mechanics-- even with the AI helper theres a lot that falls through the cracks. I feel like the special resources need to be moved, or also more information on where drains in the economy are occurring for them.... and how this effects your overall balance. I've been playing with friends, and you can clearly see the difference between those who spend hours of their life watching 30 min videos of how to play a small aspect of the game. I'm not sure if that means the game is good.. if it requires you to watch several torturous, boring, and in depth tutorials to become a advanced player. That being said, I have sunk a lot of hours playing the game solo to figure stuff out and its extremely addictive. I wouldnt say its a relaxing experience to play Stellaris... because every second counts... its kind of stressful to play on multiplayer with friends.  I end up doing well in the game... but i dont think i blink for like 3 hours-- and breathe every 10 seconds-- and we dont have time to take a bite to eat when food shows up lol. I find some aspects of the game are a little off since the 3.0 expansion... something feels off with the espionage and envoys (this new patch might require us to buy nemesis to not be punished by the new system).... it could be a fun addition but who know. Also, from the start.... I actually hate the idea of the ship building system from the beginning. I find myself just going the full tech society so that I just have the most advanced weapons/shields/everything so that it doesn't matter much to customise-- and only build ships once I have a good amount of tech so I don't waste alloys. Overall my friends and I have put in likely 500+  into this game...

4789,zer0FRANK,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zer0FRANK/,"Like any other Paradox grand strategy games its easy to learn, hard to master. However Stellaris makes several things different to other previous Paradox titles. - Randomly generated maps, no galaxy is ever the same, encounters with Empires with differ based on which direction you move in the galaxy. - Different ethics, species etc. set the battles to come, Ethics are set on an axis with polar opposites, Militarist and Pacifist, Xenophobic and Xenophilic etc. with the option to be fanatical. - Management of resources is paramount to your empire's success. - Technology sets the flow for the game, increasing tech research means you get the best warships earlier than others. - Some DLCs improve gameplay, some provide ships, some allow Hivemind and Robotic empires. To conclude this is just a short preview of what Stellaris has to offer. While vanilla can be fun, DLCs massively improve gameplay, if you do multiplayer only the host needs all the DLCs for the game to prosper for others, they are needed if you want to experience multiplayer. The newest DLC as of writing this review (Nemesis) allows you to become the end-game crisis or defend the galaxy with additional powers from the Galactic Community - you can eventually become Galactic Emperor if you so wish. While the game is fun, some of the best features are kept behind the DLC, so if you can get Stellaris and the DLCs on sale but it is a great game where no game is ever the same, from the encounters with other empires and galactic threats, to how the Galactic Community interacts with each other.",Recommended,1301.0,182.3 hrs on record,Posted: 24 April

4807,squeakyneb,https://steamcommunity.com/id/squeakyneb/,"It's a solid 4X if you're into that sort of thing, but the details that really make it stand out to me 1. The wonder and feeling of discovery in all the events. There's a lot of well written flavour text and it gives quite an existential perspective on life and its history at a galactic scale. 2. There's some automation features that let you get into the game without having to dive deep into the ship designer and planetary colony decisions. Between that and some of the other design decisions, I feel like it's both nuanced and deep like a 4X should be, but surprisingly accessible. I normally don't like 4Xs much because it's just too damn much to learn before you start really playing, but I haven't really felt this way with Stellaris. It's a good game without all the DLC, but if you really get into it the DLC just adds MORE options and things to do.",Recommended,700.0,157.3 hrs on record,Posted: 24 April

4825,BritishRedCoat,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BritishRedCoat/,"By all accounts this game is both the best and worst thing to ever happen to me. I bought this while it was on sale on Humble Bundle while I was drunk, for some reason my ape brain decided to also buy every single DLC for this game as well on a key site without even so much as knowing what the game was or is. For all intents and purposes, this should have been one of the worst decisions I have ever made, however, this game is liquid meth, and boy was I addicted. I went into this game blind, and came out remade, I sunk over 160 hours into this game over the span of about two weeks, all nighters were made, deadlines moved and plans abandoned, I was hooked. I however was blindsided by my apprehension in my first ever campaign as I, not knowing what any of the settings ment, put the empires in my first galaxy down to 5, and proceeded to live in constant fear of an eldritch force looming just beyond the next planetary system. This however didn’t mean I was gunning it alone, me not wanting to get merked right off the bat put the game in baby mode and I played as a ratchet xenomorph looking necroid who was at the head of the food chain in my federation. The overall gameplay in this can be repetitive in certain instances, but given I am a longtime fan of these Empire Building games, I am all but too familiar with the grind and have learned to somehow suffer through it with absolute raw sexual pleasure. I really love the amount of quests, lore, side objectives and random encounters this game can throw at you, it manages to keep me on my toes at every possible moment and replay it endlessly, so much so there was never really a dull moment in all my time playing. There’s a quest out there than you are able to acquire that allows you to recruit a Space Amoeba to your Intergalactic Fleet, this is portrayed through a calf attaching itself to a ship in the region believing it to be their mother, as you continue with your campaign it grows and decisions around this strange relationship deepen and you even get to name the little guy. It was absolutely delightful to receive that quest and I’m doing it a huge injustice in my coverage of it, but it was an extremely unique and wonderful experience that I think highlights the vast array of side quests that complement the campaign perfectly. Outside of that though, gameplay wise this is probably one of the most demanding 4X games I’ve played in a long while, now I want to preface this first before I go on, but remember I had done 0 research on this game before going in and had to learn everything through furious trial and error. Now, with that out the way, this game is absolutely unforgiving with its resource management - thought it would be a nice idea to make an Alien Empire as a Lithoid on a Tundra Prefered Planet, congratulations you are almost guaranteed to starve and die unless you bumrush system surveying nearby solar systems to not lose the game within the first hour. Thought colonising a planet over there was a sound idea? Boom mass Famine. Though boosting your planets to account for exceeding demand in preparation for colonisation? Boom population explosion. Has your planet run out of district, oh no it’s Xeno Floyd. Ran out of energy because you wanted to make up for a lack of resources somewhere, good luck. There is so much more that you need to keep in mind that it’s insane for an outsiders point of view, but once you start playing for maybe 4 hours or more, it all just becomes natural. Once you and the game have clicked the game is as chill as a hot tub if and when you need it to be, doubly so if you have the foresight and planning in place to anticipate spanners being thrown in the works. Next we have combat and diplomacy, now the reason these two are together is because for me they’re just small topics, now I know some will disagree but personally for me, I was able to ♥♥♥♥ out an absolute mass of just normal corvettes to kill rough leviathans and survive the end game portals event. One thing that did actually take me some time to figure out was that, sieging worlds is a lot harder than you’d think and also a lot more fun than you’d think, especially if like me you chose to be a Necromancer. Now Diplomacy is pretty eloquent and easy to understand, I really like how both government traits and racial traits make a difference on how you would be treated in any number of scenarios, I’ve had Fanatic Xenophobes with Honour Bound Warrior traits just flat out call me a huge chad and Religious Pacifist MegaCorperations to Orbital Bombard some nerds indiscriminately for a quick buck. I absolutely adore it and the depth it was given, though I am disappointed by how limited the dialogue and just some of the options are. I have seen and played plenty of games that have no storyline in the base game per say, and are all about carving out an adventure of your own kind and honestly I don’t think any of them hit it on the head as much as Stellaris manages to do. This game makes you choose your own path and set your own goals without even realizing it, via side quests, little pieces of tidbit information, architectural dig sites etc. etc, and in this game there is something truly masterful about the way the game manages to pull that off subconsciously. Now while I haven’t encountered any bugs that weren’t the result of me dog piling like 80 mods onto this poor game, I can’t say for certain that this game is in fact bug free, doubly so now a new DLC has just dropped and made my modded playlist actually unplayable. I am personally going to give this game maybe a month or so before I return and hopefully by then the issues caused by the mods will no longer be a hindrance but this can not be certain. Sorry but the extra alien portraits stays on during sex, just how it has to be. Looking past that there’s only one other thing I can talk about and that is, without a shadow of a doubt, the soundtrack. Now I know I saved the best for last, but this soundtrack is so, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, good, that I have got all of them saved on spotify and I even nearly bought the vinyl, it’s that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good. Seriously, now I can get why you’d turn it off, you know, normally playing these kinds of games they soundtrack isn’t the best and by like the 13th song you’re all like “Right bollocks to this time to put Spotify on”, I get that, I do that, but not for this game. Holy hell not for this game, wouldn’t even dream of it, everything about it works for what it’s trying to do. A solid 10/10, masterful. Finally you have the Cons, as much as I absolutely love this game, it’s not perfect. It’s so infuriatingly close to being perfect but just misses the mark by a hair. And honestly, it just because the maps aren’t big enough and there aren’t enough AI Empires, now don’t get me wrong you get a fair few, and doubly so if you manage to get some Federation pre-set empires, fallen empires, and uplifted empires, but simply put it’s not really enough. Now I always play on the largest map size, with the most civs available so I am incredibly biased and my points likely just don’t land elsewhere but by the time you’ve surveyed one quarter of the galaxy or the galactic council has been formed, everything just becomes the same after that. I don’t really know how to describe it., but I feel at that point in Stellaris should feel like expanding and conquering your way up and into a kingdom in Crusader Kings II you know, you have made your mark on the world, the map is uncovered and it's yours to go nuts with but in Stellaris it’s just like, oh, well okay anyway, and to me that’s a huge let down. I feel as though if you were to add more depth to diplomacy alongside this change, it would 100% live up to a 10/10. It’s 100% worth your time, but because I'm Mr Krabs, you should save your money then wait for it to go on sale.",Recommended,6381.0,258.5 hrs on record,Posted: 23 April

An active modding scene well-integrated into the launcher and Steam itself gives this game infinite replayability. Should we give Paradox credit for the work of modders? As a matter of fact, to some degree, yes, because it is very clear that a lot of work went into exposing certain parts of the game's code to modders (see every patch note ever) and its integration. Not many games have a mod manager (rudimentary as it may be compared to something like Vortex for you Bethesda folks out there) out of the box. If you are vehemently against paying for DLCs as you feel games have been getting less ""complete"" lately or you have been burned by the ridiculous amount of DLC for CK2, Civilization V, and the like, I think you'll find this game provides more value for the money compared to most other 4X games.

But what is really annoying that the war ends at a certain point, even when your are much stronger and did capture nearly all their systems, with this status quo option, you gain some systems, maybe they do to, depends what you have captured and what they did. This is no status quo, you would have destroyed them with abit more time, the negoation about the systems is nearly missing and then you just wait till the peace contract ends and you attack again, often they are really hard hurt and will never recover but still it takes several wars to destroy them, because of this stop war system. Even if you did caputer nearly everthing what they had and you destroyed their fleet, they don't accept under force to become your vassal, why? they are done. But what is very unbearble is when they become vassals from some one else, you can not attak anymorte their territory, and the one which their are vassals from is not necessarily conected to your territory; maybe it will work later again I don't know, but these just stretches the time you wait and this is what you do most of the time, you balance your empire and then you just wait and wait, you can do a little bit here and their but thats it",Not Recommended,1258.0,301.2 hrs on record,Posted: 21 April

What is this game about? ********************** This is a complex sci-fi strategy game which needs time. Just to get started, you will need to invest quite a few hours in-game and probably outside of the game too, reading forums, wikis, and watching youtube videos. What sets this game apart from similar titles is immersive story telling. The game shines at making you feel like an explorer of the vastness of space. You will feel epic as you discover the mysteries of the universe. You will set up colonies on foreign planets for the first time. You will stumble upon traces of alien races, and then slowly establish contact with them, and later trade, form alliances, or wage wars. It creates stories that stay in your head and you'll want to tell your friends about. A huge plus is the amazing soundtrack which perfectly combines synthesizers with real orchestra. What about the many DLCs, do I need them? ************************************** To get started, the base game is absolutely enough. I played the base game only for over 50h and had an absolute blast.  That said, if you are already pretty convinced that this game is for you, get Utopia as well. I recently started to buy DLCs, and I expect to play it for many hours more. Regarding money invested and hours of entertainment gained, I think it's very good value. Also, if you know how to search, you should be able to get a hold of the base game about 75% off or more, and all but the most recent DLCs for about 50% off. What about the newest update, I heard it's bad? ****************************************** The developer does not shy away from changing things quite a bit, and overall the game is evolving in the right direction. The recent 3.0 update has sparked controversy, and it definitively needs more balancing for advanced stages of the game. But it also greatly reduced the need for micromanagement, which I greatly enjoy and also makes it more accessible for new players.",Recommended,1671.0,162.5 hrs on record,Posted: 19 April

Update 2.0 changed that for me (along with multiple updates since then).  I have reverted back to 1.9 multiple times, and for me, the game has gotten worse over the years.  Removing and changing core features and functionality should not be ""updates"" - they should be additions to the existing gameplay, not rewriting it. I can imagine that this is the type of game I would have gotten every expansion for.  If all the expansions did was add new features and functionality without damaging the existing elements, I would be a huge fan.  As is, I have not gotten any additional content for the base game, simply because the included updates fundamentally change the game in ways that I don't like at all. I am very disappointed in Paradox for the development direction and choices they have made in this game.  I shouldn't feel like I like and respected the original game more than the developers of that game. I recommend the original game (up to version 1.9), which requires code to access the ""beta"" (old) version of the game, but I can not recommend anything newer than that, or any of the expansions, simply because they require the changes.",Not Recommended,1008.0,219.8 hrs on record,Posted: 19 April

I have just come out of the single hardest most frustrating and tense campaign I ever played, with unreliable intel leading to fighting some absolutely overwhelming wars, aggressive imperialists uniting across my borders to fight me as an alliance, and the Gigastructures mod dropping the Katzen midgame of 500k fleet power on me midgame. I just decided to completely end my playthrough of that specific campaign, however there's a reason I have 1600 hours on this game and there's a reason I'm writing a recommending review. That game brought me three things that I thought would be lost for me in Stellaris, challenging ai, a sense of mystery, and a need to improve. I love games that constantly make me ask ""what should I do next?"", ""what should I have done?"", ""what can I do better?"". After using Stellaris mods that buffed me to hell and relatively low difficulties, I found myself enjoying stellaris plainly as a comfort game. But with this update they've reinvigorated my sense of excitement and curiosity. That's the strength of Stellaris, the developers, and the community modders, both create exciting new ways to keep playing the game. The moment you think you lose interest, it will drag you back.

5115,76561198044045700,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044045700/,"Edit 04/28/21 I suppose this is going to be the last edit. The best thing about this game: - The passing: from the beginning to the end. The game evolves very well. I really like how the game changes from exploring, to expansion, to federation etc - I love the Intel system, before there were not mysteries after finding a new specie. Now it's way more challenging. - The specie role playing is really fun. - The exploration is really cool - I like the federation system - Some events are fun - The Origin system is really good, It could be even much better with ""a main quest"". Biggest problems: - First, the game is so freaking long and everything feels really slow: the movement, the research system, the time system, the pop grow system. There should be a ""Really freaking fast speed"" - The combat is really slow, you will need gates to make it faster, but to get gates you need a lot of alloys. - Trying to conquer a Planet it's a bit tedious. - Empire Sprawl is not a bad mechanic but the Buro planet's are really annoying. - Managing planets becomes tedious - Moving pops from one place to another makes no sense it would be nice that there were an immigration mechanic. Something like Imperator. - What's the purpose of every star system, 98% of the time you are going to expend your time watching the galaxy. (which by the way, I would say that it's necessary to download mods that makes the Galaxy more beautiful to watch.) - Completely unnecessary micro management like for example Starbases. There are so many nodes, maybe it would be nice templates or predetermined Starbases, like for example a Anchorage Starbase, Trade Hub etc. It's just a waste of time to go from one to another, and also checking if you need to protect trade routes from pirates. - Trade Routes is so uncomfortable to manage. - Each tier from each building, and going back jut to upgrade that building. it's so slow. Just give me a macro or something like Imperator that shows how many Pops worker are willing to change job. -The UI is not really comfortable. I like the one from Imperator. You don't have to scroll to search the building that you want to build, every building is next to each other. - In my case, I don't like to pay attention to the ship designer. I'm glad that they put an auto-designer. -The Fleet reinforcement system, is really annoying. Creating a ton of extra small fleets just to reinforce one fleet. - Managing pop in general. It would be nice an encouragement system. So for example a new colony is going to be managing Alloys, then from the start, you spend points/money so pops that are interested to work in Alloys are more willing to go to that planet. Or At least a Template system, that depending the number of pop grows the planet ends up building the template. Because in the end, a Buro planet is not much different than another Buro planet. The only problem is that it is so boring to wait each district or building to be build, that I end up building every district or building that I need in the future despite destroying the economy and knowing that the pop grows is going to be slow. It's just a waste of time. It's this game good? Yes, this game is good. But the foundation of this game is really bad. They need to change the pop system, the speed of the game, the planet micromanagement, the leaders, and make the galaxy more beautiful. A part from that, this is a good game. And I think that if in 4 years they release Stellaris 2, it's going to be much better. Because The Stellaris devs team are not afraid to change the mechanics of this game. List of really good DLC: Utopia, Federations, Leviathan. Edit 04/26/21 I found the best thing about this game compare to the others Paradox's Game. It feels really nice going from exploration -> expansion -> federation -> etc I've to say that 3.0 makes the game much better. I like now the alloys/consumer goods district, the number of buildings, the first contact. The game is way more interesting than before. One of the biggest problem about Stellaris is that the foundation are not very well done. But the game has so many things to do. Biggest thing I don't like about this game is the graphic. The game is boring to watch, the good thing is that there are mods. It's cool to look what's happening in each system, but it's small and most of the time you are going to expend your time watching lines. The music is alright. The war system is a bit boring. The exploration and federation are the best things. It's not the best Paradox's game but it's the one with the biggest changes. It's alright.",Recommended,3739.0,149.8 hrs on record,Posted: 18 April

While i am a terrible looser in many other games, having terrible game in Stellaris doesn't bother me as much, such plays are very challenging and contain sometimes story pieces hard to experience otherwise. For me the combination of a wonderful epic science fiction universe with little story tweaks that personalize quickly every species you make up, really causes me to return every now and then. Also i am on Board for more than 5y still enjoying the detail and love from the developers in an ever changing game, there is just no comparable experience for me.

5133,ak-buckeye,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ak-buckeye/,"As the owner of every game made by paradox and many many more 4X grand strategy games I have confidence my knowledge of this genre is vast. I want to start by saying out of the big 4 (HOI4, CK3, EU4, Stellaris) This is the lowest ranked on my board. Sorry any vic2 or Rome fans I don't consider them in the big 4 until Vic3 or rome receives many many updates. Now that isn't saying this is a bad game. Just in the grand strategy paradox genre this is the game I play the least. Now it's a great game. Well worth the money. But If your just getting into 4x this isn't where I would recommend you starting. You should buy Hearts of Iron 4 first. Since it deals with WW2 and you can instantly recognize a lot of what's going on. Stellaris has a steep learning curve between super easy mode and ironman where you can earn the achievements. So I'll start with a few dislikes about the game. First is the combat. There is nothing to it. Fleet power wins wars and that is just about it. Now you can customize your ships and build different ones to have certain comps that will give you an advantage but it flat out comes down to fleet power in the end. Once you build an unstoppable max cap fleet it's game over. You pretty much bulldoze anything except end game crisis. Kinda like have a tank when the world is on archers in Civ. Just not much the AI can do to stop you. Even if they were smart enough to try and build defenses you just plow through it. Next is the invasion of planets. Same thing here. It comes down to your army size/power. There is almost nothing to the combat. You bombard with space ships then invade. Now for 4x games I'd like to see something here. Give me a fast battle option to skip but if I want to fight it let me fight it. They need it to be more like planetfall or HOI4. But that's not the case. If he has 104 army power and you got 103 you lose. Just that simple. So those 2 things are major draw backs to the game for me. Last bad thing I'll say about the game is the lag gets so incredibly bad in the late stages I often don't finish. I have multiple saves that are easy wins but I just don't want to sit through the lag. I wish there was some kind of button to just fast forward a few years to end a game. The end of the game with making claims then warring, then peace, then claims, then war, then peace, then claims, then war, then peace, then claims.... You get the idea. It becomes far too grindy late game. Now the amazing. You have so many options of how to build your empire it's crazy. I have High elves, SG1, Vulcans, Replacators, Borg, Nazi Germany, Zerg, Granny's crack shack, Benders Bots, Homers Homies, Pandora's box, Africa is a lie and many many more. They are all custom empires that can spawn in any game. All of them I play vastly different. You can build a democratic empire through the federation system or be a pirate merchant. You can be a destroy everything robot like the replacators or you can try to assemble everything into your collective like the borg or maybe you go full starcraft and zerg everything with the hive mind. The possibilites are only limited by your thoughts. The early game is very fun. Lots to do and many many choices that will lead you down many paths. This is what makes the game so amazing is the first half of it. Which really boggles me because they all end the same way. But getting to that point is a real journey and your choices about how you want to build your empire are completely up to you. The game is very balanced for new people. Now with any 4x there are lots of exploits. But just don't be a jerk and play the game the way it was meant to be. Yes in HOI4 you can paradrop solo guys on all the victory points and win a war with nothing. But in reality you think 200 troops are going to capture Denver? Hell naw the citizens would be blowing them to heck. If you abuse the mechanics of course you won't like the game. You just can't program for everything. And people who take advantage of these then say the game is broken are just bad sports. Just because a flaw is there doesn't mean you need to abuse it. Besides no way in hell 1 horse is going to run around any country and capture victory points without the people that live there killing that person. But that's a different game and I'm getting off base. I want to play the game now so I'll end this here TLDR: Excellent game if you have already played the other paradox 4x games (HOI4, CK3, EU4) if you haven't try those first then come back to this.",Recommended,3631.0,359.5 hrs on record,Posted: 18 April

5190,76561198014405628,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014405628/,"This game has more replay value than just about any other.  It can be hard to get into, but once you get the hang of it, there is so much you can do.rather than a single ""campaign"" like many other games have, you're simply thrust into a massive galaxy, encountering new species and strange anomalies as you go. Complete a bunch of quests... or not.  Nothing is really forced on you.  Become a peaceful race of giant birds who operate on a democracy and like to build robots, or maybe a Devouring Swarm of insectoids that kill and assimilate everything they meet.  Use psionic power to tear your foes apart and power your economy, genetically modify your species to become the superior race of the galaxy, or even replace your entire species' bodies with mechanical forms... because reasons.  Granted, there are some downsides.  Paradox does change things often, and sometimes in dramatic ways, but there is actually an option on the launcher to play a previous version, so it's not that big of a deal.  As for the DLC, you may have noticed there's a lot of it, and many other reviews have a serious problem with it.  In truth, the game is not ""like a demo"" without any DLCs.  The game is complete (and extremely fun at that) with or without DLC.  In fact, some would argue the DLC creates a more complicated atmosphere within the game.  On that note, I would suggest playing the game without any DLCs for a start.  If you're unsure, wait for a sale.  If you enjoy it, maybe look to buy some of the DLCs, as they add a large amount of content.  Some I would recommend:   1. Utopia: megastructures are game-changing, and playing as a hive-mind empire is quite fun indeed.  2. Apocalypse: big guns, big possibilities.  3. Synthetic Dawn: who doesn't like robots?  Who doesn't like hive minds?  Put them together and you get machine intelligence.  4. Federations: Last but not least, this DLC is arguably the best one so far (haven't tried Nemesis) and adds a LOT to the diplomacy side of things, which is good as long as you're not a Devouring Swarm. Notes: Don't expect too much from species packs, they're 90% cosmetics. If you aren't into micromanagement, you can automate sectors and planets individually under your control, meaning you can focus on the bigger picture, if you're willing to trust the A.I. to build what you want. Bugs: few if any, somehow. Lots of stuff I thought were bugs were just me misunderstanding things.  If a nation closes its borders to you while you have ships in their territory, they sometimes go MIA for a few months (which is like twenty seconds in-game) and re-appear within your territory.  This is explained several times, but you have to read tooltips to figure it out. If anything changes, I will try to update the review.",Recommended,2252.0,139.6 hrs on record,Posted: 17 April

The race diversity means there is always something to adapt to when you start new games if you choose to play as a new species (or make your own!). Yes, it's a formulaic start once you understand what you're doing and there will be a little repetition in terms of 'anomaly's found' and 'relics' (if you purchase that DLC - i would recommend it personally) but even then there is so much that can change about how and what happens when you play this game - Can you build Military dictatorships with powerful navies and armies sweeping over the galaxy? Yep. Federation building that allows you to lead multi-racial fleets and build a vast hegemony to fight the superpowers that be? Yep. Enslaving primitive nations and committing 'war crimes'. Also yes. And that's just mentioning a few of the more militaristic options available to you without discussing if you purchased any additional DLC wild cards or in-game Crises that occur that WILL change it all up again. The latest 3.1 '♥♥♥♥' update and the Nemesis DLC is very good too - espionage options and how you establish first contact with species has added a new realism to the game so it feels more immersive and reinforcing 'real world building' so you will take time to consider your actions as well as the repercussions of them. Honestly - I could go on for hours about how much I enjoy this game. If you don't have the patience for grand strategy and a 'possible' slow start or you want a simple 'play for 20 mins and walk away' game then this may not be for you but I'd still urge you to buy this at sale price and give it a shot, it's got so much going for it that i'd say it wont be time wasted.",Recommended,1603.0,548.1 hrs on record,Posted: 16 April

5322,76561198297916230,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198297916230/,"Stellaris is a game like few others. While strategy games like Civilisations dumb down the complex task of running a empire, Stellaris- like all of the Paradox Interactive Grand Strategy family- impress with its strategic and mechanical depth, the sense of scale and grandeur, and the level of freedom when roleplaying a specific empire. Stellaris is a hard game to describe in a way that will remain relevant for future readers of this review. It is constantly being updated and improved by the developer, and since I started playing in late 2018, it has grown and expanded significantly from what is was back then. To start with though, there are a few things to cover. Firstly, the DLC practices for this game are...controversial, to say the least. A lot of quality of life improvements, basic features, and other necessary improvements have been paywalled behind the massive expansions for the base game. Buying and playing with at least some of these DLCs is arguably the best way to enjoy the game, and this may be a turn-off for some gamers. If you are going to purchase the bare minimum, the only three DLC that I would say are entirely necessary to fully enjoy the experience are the Utopia, Apocalypse, and Federations expansions. The various story packs are neat (but not really core to the overall experience), and the ship and species packs are just cosmetics. Secondly, the pricing for the DLCs is often absurd, with the content that should be part of the base game costing as much as a entire game would elsewhere on Steam. If you can, get them on discount. In addition to this, a lot of the stuff added by these DLCs is baited with incomplete versions of the same features in the base game (i.e. you get a handful of Origins for your empire with the base game, but most of them are added by the DLC). This is not only exploitative, but it's also kinda scummy on the behalf of Paradox. I won't go to much into the actual features, since the game is always changing, but I will briefly discuss what sort of experience you might have with this game. Stellaris has a steep learning curve (more of a learning cliff to be honest), but once you master the mechanics, you will find it to be a deep and highly nuanced simulation of galactic domination. After creating your empire, or choosing one of the prebuilt empires, you are plonked in a procedurally generated galaxy, with a single starting system, which houses your homeworld. From there, your only goal is to become the most powerful empire in the galaxy, either playing against AI-controlled empires, or other players (or both). You will need to explore new star systems to discover new habitable planets, resources, or scientific discoveries; expand your empire to these new star systems to gain control of these resources; exploit other friendly empires, rare resources, or scientific discoveries; and exterminate anything or anyone who gets in your way. By far the game's most outstanding achievement is the level of customisation and personalisation offered with creating, managing, and roleplaying your empire. You can create pretty much every fictional star empire in existence, from the United Federation of Planets, to the Imperium of Man, to the Terran Federation. Your species can range from humans to talking mushrooms, and your empire can be anything from peaceful diplomats to xenophobic militarists. Overall, Stellaris is a game that sucks you into the mechanics and experience of play. It's not as nuanced as Crusader Kings, but it's certainly a step above the vast majority of planet-bound strategy titles out there. As of this review, I have played over 700 hours of the game, and I intend to play more. I highly recommend Stellaris to anyone, regardless of whether you are a fan of the strategy genre or not. This game made me a fan of the strategy genre, when I was previously dismissive of it. 10/10, get this game.",Recommended,3233.0,727.6 hrs on record,Posted: 15 April

5347,thegorelord,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thegorelord/,"Stellaris is a great game, with numerous features, and literally infinite replayability. It has some of the most in-depth customization of the entire strategy genre, after all, you can literally create your own alien empire. The large updates and DLC add new content at the perfect rate so that when you are about to get bored... Poof! You can now form the galactic empire. I also think that Stellaris is one of the most beginner-friendly and easy to learn grand strategy games from Paradox. If you are considering buying this game, just do it. You will not regret it! Also, or the DLC, here is the overview: Nemesis - If you want to be evil, secretive, or authoritarian, this is the DLC for you. Ancient Relics - Basically for those who like the mystery of ancient civilizations, basically you get to be space Indiana Jones. Distant Stars - For those who enjoy mysterious feeling sci-fi. Definitely has Cthulhu vibes. Apocalypse - If you like the Death Star you'll like this one. Basically focuses on evil things, but more on firey terror rather than murder and intrigue, which is more Nemesis. Utopia - Adds a lot of features for making your empire feel like the sleek, shiny capital of the galaxy. Synthetic Dawn - Like robots? Get this one. Leviathans - If you find joy in killing huge space monsters, there is no better DLC for you. MegaCorp - If you enjoy an extreme-capitalism vibe, take this DLC. Federations - For the alliance-hungry diplomats among us. This one is one of my personal favorites. Species Packs are mini-DLC that add new species portraits and a couple new features: Plantoids - Plantoids are essentially sentient plants, some of them are very obviously plants, others are more subtle. Probably the weakest pack. Humanoids - My personal least favorite, but it does add ore than just cosmetics, so I am obliged to put it above Plantoids. If you like Star-Trekky, Star-Warsy humanoids, take this one. The cityscape is also probably my favorite. Lithoids - Lithoids are living rocks. They function a bit differently than others gameplay-wise, with things like they consume minerals instead of food. The Lithoids look pretty cool, and the pack adds new gameplay, so it is an overall nice DLC. Necroids - By far the best species pack. It adds grim and evil portraits, which I think are the coolest looking portraits in the game, at least some are. Necroids function the same as other species phenotypes, but the pack also adds three new civics and a new origin which allow you to fully immerse your self in the world of spacefaring death cults and sacrifices to elder gods. So yeah, that is all you will need to know to buy all the things for Stellaris. If I were to recommend an initial shopping cart, it would be the base game (obviously), Necroids, Federations, Nemesis, and Ancient Relics.

5486,vansidious,https://steamcommunity.com/id/vansidious/,"First of all, as in reviews on other Paradox games, I would like to say that it is quite annoying that there are so many DLCs. I have all DLCs for Stellaris, HOI4, EU4 and Cities: Skylines so I will not be surprised if it turns out that over $500 have already been spent. Usually these games are not really playable without DLCs (my humble opinion). Not all the DLCs are great. Anyway, these DLCs are released quite often and it seems that developers really work to improve their games. Now I would like to say something about Stellaris itself. The space setting is great for me. And developers did well. They created nice visuals, I really liked how background, stars, ships and other space objects looked. Interface is quite simple (if comparing to other Paradox games), so you can easily get used to it. Icons can help you. Adviser was helpful for me when I played for my very first time. Research system was quite difficult for me. I like how it is presented in Endless Space 2. You can see what you can achieve. In Stellaris there are three researchers: Physics, Society and Engineering (you research their techs separately and at the same time) and they give you random options to research. At my first time it was uncomfortable 'cause I could not see what was the final point of each tech tree. Now when I know which tech can lead you to the suitable result it is totally okay for me. Political system here is also good. To something you have to use points of influence. To build a starbase around a star influence is needed. To claim the other empire's star system influence is needed. To propose a resolution in the galactic senate influence is needed. The main plus as for me is Role Play. You can create your own species (even robots), you can create your empire with different forms of government. From democracies (either direct or representative) to totalitarian regimes or even monarchies. This variety also stimulates you to play one game after another. You will never get the same game. Each scenario differs. In conclusion I would like to strongly recommend you buying this game but mind your own money and better buy the game and DLCs when there are discounts.",Recommended,1792.0,192.0 hrs on record,Posted: 14 April

The game draws you in with the majesty and mystery of the universe you explore. the soundtrack is astounding. There are times when I stop the game just to watch a beautiful starsystem. What draws me most though is the the sense of discovery as you uncover stories of the history of those that came before and the innovation of those that exist now.

Create mini alliances? Vote or abstain in the Galactic Senate? -Late Game: *Ancient Empires popping out of the woodwork, extra-galactic threats, psykers (WH40k reference), warp incursions, Sapient AI uprisings, rebellious vassals, Great Galactic Wars, empires falling or fracturing CONS: *Due to being a paradox title, the base game can be pretty bland thus requiring the various DLC's to even have a chance at getting the more exciting experiences and options *Racial DLC's don't change mechanics and are mainly aesthetic except for the: Robot expansion, Necroids (death cults/dark eldar, parisites/flood/space vampires, plenty of role play value), and Lithoids (sapient rock) *At a certain point, when your population gets in extremely high the game will lag heavily even with good systems. -Early Game: *A civilization can make or break depending on origins and proximity to other civilizations, though it can be seen as adding flavor for narratives or extra starting difficulty -Mid- Game: *It is insanely long, of course it can be modified, but it feels sluggish especially once event chains dry up or no one is being proactive *Being at peace during the mid game essentially turns into a clicker type game, managing your empire, but can be alleviated through playing towards a narrative. (i.e space vampires need more thralls to make more space vampires or attempting to become a psychic race potentially starting ""Old Night"") -Late Game: *Depending on what end game threat appears, you can bet on the AI not doing anything unless the galactic threat spawns next to an ancient empire. *AI tends to turtle whenever the endgame starts, only safety net would have everyone become your vassal and you force the AI to be proactive.

If you like creating races and civilizations on the galactic scale, lead massive fleets, and plenty of sci-fi references this game is definitely for you.

I have enjoyed other space strategy games such as Galactic Civilization 3 and Sins of a Solar Empire. These days I have been struggling to find a game that can keep my attention for more than a day or so..until Stellaris. I have played the game here and there since it's release but have begun to play it extensively and have logged in over 100 hours in the past couple of weeks. The game is such a pleasure to play and I can appreciate the depth of each and every DLC and expansion that comes with it. I would have to say that the combat is better in Sins of a Solar Empire but Stellaris only barely trails it. With each and every play through of a galaxy map I am uncovering and discovering new things. The sound track is best in class and the fact that the game continues to be updated is great. I have had the pleasure of watching some 30 player tournaments and other content that has been created by players. I am eagerly looking forward to the Nemesis Expansion and future content. Here is to hundreds of more hours of play.

5711,zandernick11,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zandernick11/,"I think this is one of the best grand strategy games mainly because of the combat. With the other Paradox grand strategy games, the combat isn't really engaging, its pretty clunky and it looks REALLY dumb. But with Stellaris, the combat looks REALLY COOL, with tons of ships flying around attacking other ships. It is almost like a mini RTS game (even though you can't move units while attacking)! Very unique! Another thing about Stellaris is the randomness with it. You can play the game over and over, and every game will slightly be different. That factor alone definitely adds longevity to the game. Final thing, this game runs very well compared to other grand strategy games, I can achieve 200+fps of the time (on fast speed), and with my mid range setup, the game will usually be around 100+ fps near the end game.  One downside is the amount of locked content behind DLC, but I think that is pretty obvious from other reviewers as well.

Every newly generated galaxy feels different with empires, species, anomalies to discover. After playing for hundreds of hours, the random nature of each galaxy still throws unexpected tactical or strategic challenges. The storytelling element is awesome, as you lead your race exploring and ultimately taking its place amongst the galactic races. The game allows you to dynamically name planets, ships, sectors and write your own lore for empires you play with. It also does a great job allowing you to minmax ship classes, or accept auto-generated setups if you don't want to overcomplicate things. The devs also constantly add new features or rework old mechanics based on community feedback. The current game is totally different from what you'd been playing years ago. The huge player base and active forums years after this game first released is a testament to how strongly this game has come to define the scifi strategic genre.

The AI is challenging enough even on easy mode if you're not paying attention or fortifying appropriately. One worm-hole or jump gate left unprotected provides the opportunity for major disruption in operations, even with a commanding fleet. Content has been released steadily since the initial release and remains in active development. I really enjoy the species tinkering when genetic traits are unlocked as well as the ability to treat alien species as nice or with as much cruelty as a player fancies. Easy to dive into, plenty of time to master. The closest comparison I could make is Master of Orion x 4 in scope and size. The research tree also is never ending, providing infinite abilities to raise energy and mining efficiency, extend leader lifespan or empower space platforms and armies.

Now why would you want to play this game? well for starters if you like government building based strategy games, especially ones you can really customize, this is a great take on what a space version of those would be, my favorite aspect about this game is how customizable it is. theres a good variety of races, flag customization, governing ethics and even the structure of your government. you get sucked into the story of your empire no matter if its based off of something, a joke empire or even something completely random and made on the spot. you'll have struggles and your empire can fall easily if you arent careful. the game isnt kind if you overstep and decide to try and conquer the galaxy they will fight back. If you wish you can have previously made empires join your game either randomly or make it that they will 100% be in the game, making some interesting gameplay at times. not to mention you can get some friends and play with them or even do pvp but im more of a solo player so i cant really talk on that part of the community, im sure they're others here that have talked about it ;) TL;DR Good game, if you enjoy get dlc's they make the game way better.",Recommended,1314.0,275.4 hrs on record,Posted: 3 April

I own and have played almost all of Paradox's Grand Strategy games and in my humble opinion, this one takes the cake. Each playthrough varies just enough to feel fresh but familiar enough that you don't feel overwhelmed. The way you build your race, your government, even your ships can liven up the game each time you play not to mention the random neighbors and starting position you may have. One playthrough your nearest neighbor may be a race completely devoted to wiping out all other sapient life whereas the next you may have federation builders sharing your borders. The difficulty scales very nicely. The lower difficulties can help you ease into playing the game where the higher difficulties will test the foundations of your skills. Each failure feels like you've learned something important and every success points out what could be done better. Overall, I would highly recommend Stellaris.

5900,76561198040934305,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040934305/,"First off, a disclaimer- I'm a huge strategy game nerd, be it RTS, Turn based, 4x, or whatever other sub genres get made up in the interim- I play 'em all. Second- this game is not without faults, so take the below glowing recommendation with a grain of salt knowing that even the best offerings could have detracting elements. In my case, it is mainly the end game lag, and the loss of interest once the tech tree stops branching and becomes nothing but repeatables... Minor infraction, the latter, software limitation, the former. I'd also prefer a bit more fleshing out of the ground combat model, but what exists is passable, if simplified. Since I've strayed into petty gripes (which speaks well of the game itself IMO), I'd like more ship classes and the ability to modify and upgrade relic vessels (ships you find from random missions or are gifted). But I digress... Do I like this game? Absolutely, though it was not always so. I bought it years ago, and it didn't catch my attention the same way some other titles had (Ascendancy, Master of Orion, Galactic Civilizations, Sins of a Solar Empire, even Star Trek Birth of the Federation & Armada, and Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds, Rebellion, and Empire at War, Sid Meier's beyond earth, and Pandora: First contact). But I gave it another go- and I was hooked. It is infinitely replayable and complex, but not overwhelmingly so. It took me a while to learn some of the interior systems like managing planets and pops, making claims before going to war, etc. I still sometimes end up with my economy upside down or the community hating my created species.  It's all part of the charm. I recently got to try out multi player. I thought being a 4x game with a pause feature, that MP would become a huge mess. It really wasn't that bad, and watching a friend's species come to life beside yours is immense fun. An added bonus, only the host needs to have a given DLC installed for all players in that MP game to make use of. For example, I have all the DLCs but my other player only had 1 or 2. In our MP game, they were all available to him. A nice choice of features. This game is 5 years old and is still receiving regular dev updates- in fact a new content pack (DLC) is coming out in April 2021. If that's not enough, it has a near rabid fanbase and modding community who will happily keep this game new and exciting in perpetuity. The planets are gorgeous and varied, the space combat is a treat to watch zoomed in, and each new event pushes you to play just a little longer... I cannot stress how in depth the RP (Role-playing) possibilities are for this game. You can literally create every facet of a species down to their origin story and driving ethics and civics, to their preferred planet type, then take them to the stars to weave their tale into whatever reality you see fit. Will you ascend to become perfect synthetic beings? Touch the Shroud and break the plane of Psionics? Become genetically gifted super beasts? It's all yours for the taking. The learning curve is a bit steep, but once the basics are mastered, the real fun begins. The tutorial is a bit lacking but thankfully there are several content creators who provide more in depth ""how to"" style videos (I'm looking at you, ASpec) to fill in the gaps until you feel confident striking out on your own. Hate managing Pops while playing wide? There's a mod for that. There's an edict for that. You can even let the AI automate your sectors (not recommended for most players however). In short, if you love stategy, sci fi, role playing, in any combination, or have played and enjoyed any of the titles I mentioned above, or come from something like Civilization or Total War, Give this game a try. Odds are, you won't be disappointed. See you among the stars!",Recommended,3108.0,600.9 hrs on record,Posted: 30 March

Its even easy to make your own mods, for someone that only knows hjson. Replay Value: 10/10. This game has so much replay value its insane. At least 500+ hours without mods to explore all the options, achievements, ascension perks, etc, and you can even expand that by 1,000+ hours with mods. Difficulty: 0/5. I have never been able to play a strategy game before without difficulty, I have tried Niche, Hoi4, and many other games, however this game is the ONLY strategy game I can actually play, and play casually. Of course I change the options, but I can actually PLAY this. If you are like me, and have difficulty, the options are easily changeable to something easier.

They treat their players with respect, their games have quality as software and as games, they keep adding and fixing stuff for years. But all too often, their games are just not fun for me. When Stellaris first came out, I called it a ""1X"" game, because while the expoloration phase was fun, expansion quickly ground to a halt, exploitation was somewhat-artificially limited to prevent pulling ahead, and actually winning militarily was a pipe dream. Even then, you could choose some game setup options, and use some mods, to make the galaxy more interesting, but in the end, for me the game ground to a halt soon after first contact. A lot has changed in the intervening years, and I might actually get into it now. They've fine-tuned things and thrown out some things that don't work. You can still use mods to get rid of the artificial growth limitations. In its current form, it's a loooong game with some meaty economics and some nifty story bits (at least the first few times you see them). I don't think it's going to hold my attention for months on end the way I want it to, because it still gets a little tedious, but I find myself enjoying the current state of the game a lot more than I did its original form.",Recommended,1039.0,546.7 hrs on record,Posted: 28 March

5973,76561198244654644,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198244654644/,"It took a while to get into this game.  The first time I played, I found the interface quite confusing, and the game quite repetitive, almost to the point that I wasn't going to play again.   Playing a second time was much better, once I had a better idea of what I was doing, particularly with the some of the more story elements that break up the main game. As for the negatives: 1) I would have likely more automation over the constructors, and science ships, e.g., maybe the ability to tell them what to focus on. 2) Personally, I sometimes found that the automated control of the planets didn't seem to do anything unless you clicked on manual and back to automated again. 3) The help information generally didn't seem to be that helpful, and I often had to resort to the wiki to figure out how to fix something (e.g., increase naval capacity).  It would be good if for each of the attributes in the game it had help information to indicate the different mechanisms for increasing that attribute. 4) I wasn't able to build a juggernaut.  It wasn't obvious to me that the ascension perk to do this was called ""colossus"", and by the time that I wanted to build one I didn't have any perks left.  Perhaps giving it a better name would have been better. 5) The fleet interface was infuriating.  I have about 100 different random ""New Fleet"" fleets that were automatically created with one ship.  I accidentally once pressed the ""Upgrade your fleets"" button, and it ripped my existing fleets apart (that I couldn't then put back together again until I reloaded), and started building lots of random ships.  The fleet interface seems like a good idea, but it needs the bugs worked out, and it should warn if about to make big changes to your current fleets. In conclusion, I think that this is a good game, and I enjoyed playing it once but probably won't play it a second time. With some work and polish, this could end up being a really great game, but I don't think it is quite there yet! Rob",Recommended,1623.0,48.3 hrs on record,Posted: 28 March

As you can probably tell by my play time, this is my favorite game. I really love the freedom and quantity of options there are available, it truly feels like it is infinitely replayable, especially with the great modding community for this game. It strikes a good balance between being easy to get into, and hard to master. It isn't perfectly balanced, but it takes a very narrative focus, which is something I like. For example, one of my most memorable games I played an empire where its home world exploded not too far into the game, and I designed the entire empire on the idea of ""We lost our home, so we provide refuge for other refugees like us."" Much later into the game, when the end game crisis started, my empire was relatively far away from it. But the massive amount of refugees ruined my economy, crippling my fleet production. By the time the crisis reached me, they steam rolled my empire and I didn't stand a chance, which made for such an interesting dilemma, because I probably would have won had it not been for the refugees. And as for multiplayer I really like that only the host needs the dlc (all of which is totally worth it) for everyone to get to play it. This is relatively minor, but I would like to see a more indepth planetary invasion / armies mechanics. As of writing this, things like your species habitability modifiers don't impact their ability to fight on planets, would be cool to have desert species struggle on arctic worlds. But that's not as important as things like managing economy, diplomacy, enslaving entire species, and blowing up planets. So yes, if you have the money and the time, buy this game. And all of its dlc, absolutely worth it if you're even somewhat interested. Thanks Paradox such a great masterpiece.",Recommended,1511.0,714.7 hrs on record,Posted: 27 March

Major problems: With a large galaxy, the game really tends to slow down, and even crash a few times as the game goes on DLC is kinda required, similar to Civ games",Recommended,463.0,650.9 hrs on record,Posted: 27 March

6037,steamsupportsux,https://steamcommunity.com/id/steamsupportsux/,"TLDR :If you enjoy blowing money on hard luck cases, you found the right spot. If you are wanting a comparative 4x experience, save your money and keep looking. If you are expecting a PC game that was ported to console, then you'll be sorely disappointed. For those expecting /looking for a Civ type experience... this is about half of it. Decent graphics and the engine runs smooth, to a point, but considering this has to run on consoles... a lot was left out to keep that compatibility. It may be a decent console game, for what it is, but the negatives for PC are just too heavy on this one. As others have noted, this is way too flimsy of a game for the cost(s) they are asking for (base +DLC's), especially considering the base game is now 5+ years old. Take it down to about a 5th of the current Steam prices and it would be more realistic, but even then its rough going for the PC users, especially with the lack of automatons and 'features' that you take for granted in other any contemporary 4x titles and are non-existent here. First up, lack of PC keybinds (or even options to keybind). This one is a no brainer for the last decades 4x games of this ilk, so why they skimped here... consoles, bleh. So, on a PC, you are mostly left with mouse here, mouse there, click here, and click-click-click (again, lacking keybinds or direct number input - but hey, go consoles!). The keybinds we do have are inconsistent (ie: U = upgrade, but not for all upgrades. some you still have to track back to click on). I hope you have a really good trackball (and I do have a trackball, and its already hurting, so yeah...) and/or a really good doctor, because carpel tunnel, here we come! 2nd: scaling and positioning (TLDR: prepare for some pain if you have large format screen(s)). While looking to the far right of your wide/ultrawide/4k + screens, try making adjustments to the numbers that are stuck on the left side of the screen (or vis versa). So now on top of carpel tunnel, we are now giving ourselves whiplash. The only way I found to balance the screen scrolling and clicking vs the flow of the game was to pause, a lot. Pause, react, un-pause, repeat. Over, and over, and over. Which leads to the 3rd point: lack of automation here that is, by comparison, taken for granted in other 4x titles. So far, only 1 action for one unit is able to be automated. Everything else, at best (and where possible), is queued. Talk about monotonous repetition... at least it is not pencil and paper on a table top.. but it comes darn close. And these are just the top 3!",Not Recommended,2093.0,19.6 hrs on record,Posted: 26 March

I work 10-12 hours a day, and have to be very selective with what games I play and can't afford dropping $40 on a game I just don't see myself enjoying. I understand my review is less than 1 hour of game time, but that was enough for me to know this isn't the game for me. That said though, I can see where the game devs are going with this game. It's not bad, I just don't have the time to learn how to play efficiently. I spent about half an hour trying to figure out basic controls, and still really dont have an understanding of the rest of the features. I won't give this a negative review due to ignorance. As a warning to anyone else like myself: -Buy this game if you want Civilization on crack and steroids. -Don't buy this game if you thought this was going to be another EVE, Everspace, or Avorion. Note: The game has an absolute F TON of things to learn, and if you're not paying close attention to the tutorial that has 50% narration for the unimportant junk, and 50% text for the parts explaining how to do anything, you'll end up like me missing out on crucial information that ultimately lead me to moving on to another game(as I stated, I have limited time, and if a game takes too long to play, or learn, I just have to pick up and go).

When I started out, the galaxy looked very different but both in terms of base gameplay and overall gameplay, with three different modes of FTL travel. At the moment, there is one base mode of travel and three extra modes of travel that can be unlocked through normal gameplay. The game has been added to continuously since launch. Importantly you can roll back to previous versions to try this out. In general, I recommend you do. Each game is going to be somewhat different and will give you a different view of the galaxy. You can play as democratic crusaders and bring FREEDOM to the galaxy, but you can also play as a *benign* megacorporation, a civilization in flux, or as galactic imperialists. You get to choose which. I would recommend being prepared to finish your ironman game quickly, and be prepared to manually ""upgrade"" your longer-term games in case of a serious update which changes certain rules.

There is no absokute goal in the game other to keep your civilaziation well and alive. It's a huge sandbox and you can create your own stories. There is no main story to follow, only your imagination tells those stories. You'll remember your stories of rise and fall of empires and civilizations. The battles you've fought, the wars you've won and lost. The creation of something grater than yourself. There are so many stories to tell and each of those is unique. But beware of a sometimes really weird AI and a not so well optimized engine for larger galaxies with huge population. But the game is supported by the devs and the community and they improved a lot. I only can do my duty and recommend this game to all who love those kind of games.",Recommended,843.0,162.3 hrs on record,Posted: 22 March

So far galatic counsil seems pretty much like ♥♥♥♥, Federations can make strong fleets (combined tech) but the ""changing ownership of navy"" is less then ideal mechanic. Also Federation members should automatically join all wars. All in all I find it a good game, though its pricy if you want all the DLC´s - so Id say get it on offer.

Galactic Civilizations is more newbie friendly and has better ship design features.  What Stellaris has though is depth.  So much depth and customization and options.  It's honestly pretty overwhelming. The ""real time"" vs. ""turn based"" dichotomy doesn't really apply here.  The game starts things moving, but slow.  So you speed it up and make it go fast, real fast.  But then you end up pausing it constantly, managing your civilization and telling everyone what their next steps are, and then... just let it run.  Until something happens and you pause, tweak, and release again.  It's not turn based; you -have- to let the galaxy move and everyone act simultaneously.  But it's not real time either; you'll constantly be pausing and checking things and reading stuff.  Or not.  Maybe you'll never pause and just react to the game some other way.  Remember, this game is about the options. One serious shortcoming is that while there are tutorials, they don't really teach much of anything.  Your first few games you'll lose, simply because you're learning what all the icons mean.  The next few games you'll lose because you're trying to understand the deeper mechanics of the game (""you have unspent civic points.""  What the frak are civic points, and how do I spend them?!?!).  Then you'll advance to losing games because you need to learn the actual strategies involved in winning.  Plus, chances are, you're playing different starting races each and every time. But it's good, and fun, and well worth checking out. Just wait for a sale.  4 years in and Stellaris' price is dropping.  I picked up the base game and some DLC for $15 on Humble Bundle.  And I say ""wait for a sale"", not because it's overpriced necessarily, but because there's well over $200 if you buy the game and the DLC at regular price.

Well, it has a lot to offer. You can create your own custom races for your preferred play style. This includes picking a skin, origin, government, and ethics to mention a few. It goes deep. It remains dynamic throughout a campaign. Your citizens ethics change based on the circumstances of the galaxy they inhabit and the paths you choose as a player. As your people become more sophisticated you can expand government benefits, even allowing foreign races to become full citizens. That, or you could purge the aliens and heretics. It's up to you. You develop planets through policies, districts, and structures. The number of policies you can have active is limited by their compatibility with each other, but technically there is no hard cap. Districts require large planets or rare planetary features. Structures are capped based on population and have a hard cap of 16. That's plenty. You can create fortified space stations and live a peaceful life of leisure if you want. Instead, I tend to design my own armada to prowl for pirates and dominate my rivals. Ships have fixed hard points for slots, but a good variety of weapons can be slotted on each class. The larger classes of vessels have special auxiliary slots for passive bonuses, and you can choose to reinforce a ship's hull, armor, shields, or let it wander space virtually naked to save yourself a few resources.

6336,iNinjaN,https://steamcommunity.com/id/iNinjaN/,"Its a simpler 4X game than many others, a lot more accessible. For me I can't really recommend it without a good number of expansions, the base game was (back during release at least) too simple and didn't keep me engaged for even one run through. A few expansions in there were more systems to engage with and the game got a lot more enjoyable. The later updates has streamlined a lot which is both good and bad. The good is that a lot of the micromanagement is completely gone, the bad is that for large stretches of time there's little to actually do but let the time pass. The first 20% or so of a game can safely be run on fast or even fastest since all you do is map territory, expand to key choke points, initiate colonies and generally prepare. Things start moving more slowly and become more game-y when you reach the mid-game where you'll have your first wars and need to be more careful in terms of not leaving yourself vulnerable and making sure you don't get squeezed out expansion wise. It's fun in the most classic of ""just one more turn"" ways, where it lacks is depth of combat (where Total War is king imo) and that alternative play styles, for me, are very boring. Being a pacifist is just not very fun and you generally have a hard time avoiding being attacked. A very good aspect is that the game has many difficulty levels so you can tune in to a level where it is perfectly challenging without feeling impossible. However the harder difficulties have the typical strategy game ""unfair"" type balancing, where the AI doesn't really get smarter, they just have a big head start, but that is par for the course in the genre so I won't fault the game for that.",Recommended,1367.0,145.9 hrs on record,Posted: 17 March

Makes me sad when i encounter neutral ships, which has a lot more stuff on their ship. ( number of slots for weapons and utility ) I don't know why, but game is slowing down a lot around year 2400. Makes game unplayable in the high end game. I think this game can use something like fleet revamp. Reworking system, which limits you a lot by number of slots for ships. Also AI can use some love and improvement. Even on highest dificulty, AI gets just economy boost and thats it. I don't know why, but AI keeps a lot of small fleets, which are mostly inefective even when AI is strong. (For example when I am in war, my allyes do not protect them self.

Exploring the stars and slowly moving your people through the universe, starting new colonies, building space stations and mining bases. Your science ships, in addition to mapping the stars will encounter anomalies they can spend on examining, occasionally starting a chain of events with small results, but in others they may change the fate of your civilisation. Going out into the universe you will encounter life forms of all types. Huge space amoeba, ancient mining stations which can be hostile to your exploration and block your progression in that direction until you find mean to communicate or build up a fleet to defeat them. You will also encounter other sentient races. Some young ones like yours just now moving out among the stars with whom you may trade, engage in diplomacy and turn into allies or enemies of ones form or another. They all come with different physical traits but also traditions. But also ancient empires who have drawn back to only a few planets and star systems, they will usually be friendly but their superiority and disinterest in anything beyond their borders make cooperation difficult, Just beware not to wake them up from their semi slumber without good reason as their wrath can be terrible. On occasion you may also come across pre flight populations whom you can study, lift up, protect or exploit. Similarly space stations or civilisations who are not interested in moving beyond their world. Some of these will trade with you and any other spacefarers passing by them. Others may aid you in your research or exploration. But exploration and expansion also bears great risks and you may not only destroy your own people but the whole universe if you are not careful. After hundreds of years among the stars you may have to ally up with other cultures including the stagnant empires and fend of an enemy stronger than anything you encountered before. Every game is different, you might encounter events that you already saw in your previous game. But the shear number of events leads to incredible variety. So Stellaris comes with huge re-playabiility On caveat, which oddly also shows the time invested by the design team, is how regularly the game is updated, changing small but also big parts of the system. Since I started playing movement between the stars changed massively, so did expansion of your borders and managment of your colonies. So if you've been out of the game a bit you might have to relearn it all from scratch, well most. But this can also be a lot of fun. So if I were to rate the game on a 9 star basis it would only lose half a star for this, being a 7.5 or even 8. One note. I have never managed to play a game to its conclusion. Sometimes because I just wasn't prepared for the end game challenges. Other times because it just took such a long time to play. But you can change many of the game setting including faster play and difficulty. And even not completing a game is huge fun. This game can be pretty adictif, but in a positive sense. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",Recommended,2591.0,304.7 hrs on record,Posted: 15 March

Stellaris is an outstanding sci-fi RTS that gives you options for immense customization of your own civilization and various gameplay opportunities such as economy, trade, warfare, and general management. You don't have to play any singular play style as you have a lot of options; you can be a galactic crusader seeking to enslave all alien life in the galaxy, a greedy industrial nation attempting to stay out of conflict to profit off of other powers, a federation of explorers looking to spread peace and diplomacy, or a simple space hippy commune that just wants to farm in peace. You have even more gameplay options in multiplayer with player politics, although singleplayer is great in its own right. The main faults of Stellaris are late-game performance issues and, like most Paradox games, heavy reliance on DLCs. The game is still great in vanilla with no DLC, but you'll likely find it bare-bones as you realize all of the more grandiose features are missing.

The game is a bit slow at first, but you get the resources you need and establish yourself as a small empire, that's where the pace quickens. I love you how you can create space civs that can appear in your matches. I've created the Froot Loop League, a democracy of toucans, and the Meowster Corporation, cat people that enslave others. There's no main storyline, but rather there's so many different events that can occur that each playthrough is unique. Really, you're essentially piecing all of these events together in your head to form your own story. If you're into that sort of thing, it's pretty epic.

I'll start with what's wrong, since that's probably what you're looking for if you're reading reviews. Stellaris, like most Paradox games, has a very high bar of entry for new players. When I first bought the game, I opened it once, got intimidated by all the controls, and didn't play again for another month. I had seem youtube videos and the game looked easy, so I thought I knew what I was doing. However, unless you're 200 IQ, you'll probably have to watch a youtube tutorial to understand all the mechanics of Stellaris. Stellaris is also a pretty bland game without DLC. As many people will say, a few key DLC are recommended to see the full potential of Stellaris. Personally I would recommend Utopia, Distant Stars, and Federations. These three DLC add most of what I think new players imagine they want in a game like Stellaris. Now for the positive; practically everything else. The game is fun, engaging, and allows for a huge amount of creativity. I wont go into too much detail since others have done much better than me on that.

While the DLC model can be frustrating, I would argue other than species packs each add depth and flavor not required to initially enjoy the game but to make it more complex and offer more story creations. That is what stellaris is, you build a story. Each play through, even if playing as the same faction brings new challenges and new stories. It is an ever evolving game where everything feels fresh no matter what play through you are on. Multiplayer is also good imo. While I have only played with friends I know and cant speak for the random lobbies, you can either assist and play cooperatively or play competitively. Both offer fun experiences.

6628,PatientEmber,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PatientEmber/,"I'm not even finished my first playthrough but I decided I was ready to give this game a thumbs up anyways. If like me you've played Sins of a Solar Empire and Endless Space 2 and enjoyed them, Stellaris should be up your alley. I haven't played many 4X grand strategy games like this nor have a played many other Paradox games (just crusader kings). I didn't find getting over the learning curve particularly difficult as long as you're willing to do a tiny bit of reading on the fandom wiki or reddit or in the steam discussions. The tutorial will cover some basics but it won't teach you rule of thumbs like... should you try to colonize everything or wait for terraforming technology first? Should you focus on research or industry in the early game? etc. Speaking of early game, well I'm just playing on ensign difficulty right now and playing mostly on normal speed (and micro-managing a lot) so I'm only about 40 years in (a standard game is approx 300 years) so if you find the early game boring just remember that it starts to get more exciting after the first few decades. Use that fast forward button to speed up time! And remember that you don't need to micro-manage! The option is there for those that enjoy it. But if micro-managing bothers you, well you can set science ships (scouts) to auto-explore, you can put military vessels on patrol routes, you can set up monthly trades in the market menu, you can automate the management of jobs and construction projects on colonies, and so on. Based on what games I have played it basically feels like a mash up of Sins of a Solar Empire and Endless Space, with maybe a sprinkle of Civilization and a bunch of other games I've never played. Quick tips for new players: - If making a custom empire seems intimidating at the start, don't. Try out one of the pre-made ones! - Build lots of science ships early, like 4 science ships as soon as you can is not a bad idea as long as you have the energy credits to hire the scientist leaders that command the science ships. Then send them out to start surveying as many systems as possible. They are your scouts and they also buff the resources on future systems that you might colonize whenever you tell your science ships to 'investigate anomalies'. - Pretty much 99% of star ships are built at you shipyards, which are built at your starbases. Once you have the resources you should build colony ships at your shipyards (after sending out some science ships). - Once you've met some other empires, try not to spend much influence on diplomatic things like 'guarantee independence' or 'non-aggression pacts'. Like maybe your closest neighbour is a good idea. But the rest of your influence, you should save that for building outposts (mini-starbases built by construction ships. Use construction ships to build outposts on systems that you've fully surveyed, to expand your borders and claim systems.) - Hold off on the DLC's until you've played a full game at least once, IMHO. If you must buy at least one DLC right off the bat, buy Utopia. If you've just got money to throw around and need 2 DLC's buy Utopia and MegaCorp. Many players pass on Apocalypse and Federations DLC's.",Recommended,2619.0,298.2 hrs on record,Posted: 7 March

Con section might be bigger, but thats to explain. Cons: 1.Performance has been hit and miss. Desync is a real problem in multiplayer games. You used to never be able to finish due to player desync the game would just slow to a crawl. since 2.8 the problem has gotten much better but haven't played till the end to confirm how much better it has gotten. 2.learning curve is substantial while it is fairly easy to learn the basics and get to the end of a game.

However I cannot recommend this game as every time I get into Late game (with or without Mods but mainly with as it's more fun) I get around 10-35 fps constantly and it just becomes horrible to play. This was with my old PC (not rubbish btw) that I've had for ages and runs other high end games no problem, yet I got as far as crashing when it Auto Saves, so I gave up till I got my new PC. I recently decided to run the game on my new High End PC and oh wow it still runs like S*** at around 10-40 fps. AMD 5900X 64GB RAM ASUS TUF Gaming OC RX 6900 XT M.2 SSD Yet such low fps and I have no idea how anyone is expected to complete/finish or win a game.

The strengths of the game lie in its personalisations and its interesting variety of races to interact with. Its main strength however lies with the possibility of an immersive multiplayer RPG. Cons: In many ways the game is poorly optimised and without the DLC's you possibly find yourself at a disadvantage when facing other races. Gameplay without DLC's can get a little stale. Depending on the game settings, a game can start off run but become nothing short of a slog towards the end.

6661,PsiborgJhin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PsiborgJhin/,"Pros:[/b] [/h1] This is by far one of the best space 4X games in existence, It provides a depth of complexity and wealth of options to make every game a challenge but not making any specific playstyle option more powerful than any other. Also, this game has a vibrant modding community that produces mods that can change the entire fabric of the game such as Giga engineering that expands on the games canonical mega engineering by allowing grander projects such as turning moons into starships. Cons:[/b] [/h1] All games have a downside and this game is no exception. Firstly, the AI is pretty weak and you can learn to play hack them if you do enough games and they are too mechanical and they can break the immersion you have playing and doing rapid fire decisions, however, this is a problem for true veterans of the game because you'll be too focused on how to move forward when you're first starting this game. Secondly, the coding implementations for things such as the population units and ships can make the game crawl when you have 32 empires each with 10-30 colonies with 10-80 pops, the game will go from being very fast to being almost at halt even on the max speed due to all the empires with all their different pops and ships all doing their thing (which is always calculating). personally I don't know why they implemented it the way they did, but i prefer their attempt over the implementation i've seen in other games. Thirdly, P2P multiplayer... Do i need to say more? yes? well, with the propensity to have games get really bloated, if you have this in multiplayer while you're trying to play with your friends, you must all have good computers because the slower computers will drag the whole game down. come to this game with your battleship computers.

6708,Clockwork2007,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Clockwork2007/,"TLDR: I would recommend the game, but only with the DLC. By itself, its a hollow and empty experience. The good (with DLC): This game has a lot of potential to be fun. Think Civilization in space at the scale of space empires spanning entire quadrants of galaxies. You can control everything from individual districts on your planets, to army tactics, and political factions in your empire. The choice: You can start out by making your own civilization. The initial options are pretty basic (being able to specialize your civilization to a certain degree. For example making them smart, good at engineering, while not so great soldiers. The point system makes you balance the good traits with the bad), however with mods you can enhance the options you have. Some mods can make your games down right unbalanced, so you kind of have to pick and choose mods. But the important thing is that you have the options. You can create a species of Devouring bugs that go from planet to planet eating other species. Or hyperadvanced militaristic empire. Or peaceful space hippies that want to hug everything (and get eaten by the bugs). Its up to you. The tech tree: The tech tree functions like a deck of cards. You have a certain amount of tech options and you can research each one. Once you research it, you draw another. The better the technology, the rarer it is. Of course, there are still pre-requisites and tech paths you can go down on, but its a lot less transparent than traditional games. You aren't just given the tech tree... you have to discover it on your own. The mods: There is a very thriving modding community for Stellaris. Its not quite to the level of Skyrim (lets face it, nothing is when it comes to mods), but there are mods for pretty much everything. The bad: The vanilla game can be a little boring and repetitive. I like the addition of space Anomalies you can explore with your science ships. its nice. Feels very star trechie. But holy ♥♥♥♥ are they way too common. Most systems have at least one anomaly. Many have multiple. It makes the reward of finding one pretty ""meh"" near the end. It becomes a chore that you end up ignoring after a certain point. Most of the anomalies don't feel at all significant. They are just a thing that slows down your surveying for a mild reward. Some put you on decently cool side stories involving multiple systems, but most are just meh. The elephant in the room: DLC's. The game is not complete without the DLC. This is can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. On one hand, if you want the full game, you have to drop around a hundred bucks for all the gameplay DLC's (the cosmetic ones you can skip). Its a steep price to pay for a game. One the other hand, the game is still in development and still gets new content after so many years! The DLC's are more akin to old school expansion packs, and less like things that were supposed to be in the game that the studio is asking extra money for. Each DLC adds something to make the universe feel deep, alive, and immersive. As much as I hate the DLC model that the majority of the industry has adopted, Stellaris (and other Paradox titles) do it justice most of the time (except for Imperator: Rome). The DLC's make this game worth recommending, which can only mean they are a good thing, right? In conclusion: Game is good. Long live the Federation of Space Snails that eat other species!",Recommended,2797.0,103.8 hrs on record,Posted: 4 March

6726,76561198042776235,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042776235/,"Probably the best galactic 4X strategy game out there. If you can't handle the breathtaking pace of the Civilization games and need something slower, this is the game for you. Seriously, travelling from one end of the universe to the other really takes time in this game. Also, you need a decent rig. Don't try to play this on slower computers. You will suffer. Now, one thing to mention is that this is a Paradox game, and these guys have a tendency to tinker with their games a lot. It is a very different beast now than from when I originally bought it. Hey, by the time you get it, it'll probably be an FPS. But the version that I'm reviewing is a 4x strategy game. You explore, settle, control, fight etc. There's a pretty heavy learning curve, as there's a lot of currencies and parameters to balance. You can easily play the game without taking them too seriously, but you will find the game a lot harder. In fact, once you start mastering the game, it can be a bit too easy. If you have played a lot of Civ, you will notice that they tend to have a good bit of time, where you're really not doing anything. They try to hide it by giving you trade routes etc. making it seem as if something is happening. The Paradox approach is to give you little stories/tasks/missions throughout the game, which really makes a lot of difference. Once you have played a lot you start recognising the stories (mind you, many of the stories have multiple possible endings). But it helps keeping the game going. The graphics are actually really good, but like Supreme Commander you end up playing everything up in the layer where you only see tokens. There's a lot of DLC for this. I recommend starting off with Utopia, and when you grow bored with that, get Ancient Relics. Right now I'm waiting for Nemesis, so I can't recommend that yet. If you are new to 4x, this may not be the best place to start. If you are just looking for a new 4x, this is definitely one you should give a try.",Recommended,1609.0,510.8 hrs on record,Posted: 3 March

Beautiful graphics, really good gameplay, AI is on top notch perfomance and it's never boring. There's a lot of variety in the game, play as you like. Overall, gameplay wise and visually i'd say strong 10 out of 10, but my problem with this game starts in year 2400-2450. The fps drop from 144 to F@KING 10, WHAT IN THE OBLIVION IS THAT???? Within first hour of gameplay you'll rocket from 2200 to 2300, after 2400 it'll take almost a hour for a ONE YEAR GAMEPLAY. How effing frustrating it is, play tall or play wide, play large galaxy or the smallest. You will have most horrrrrrriiible experience in the late game. Doesn't matter, rock good ol' intel pentium III or ryzen 9 5900X, doesn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ matter. Game is just so horribly optimized that in the late game it's literally unplayable. Waste 40€ on a game, another 50€ for DLC-s to enjoy the game (in my case i bought all the dlcs whiiiich roughly is around 90€ total) and my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ god, is Paradox going the ubisoft way? Oooohh, they bought the game for juicy money, eeehhh no need to fix anything just toss in some irrevelant content rather than FIX THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PERFOMANCE ISSUE! It has been issue since 2016 the game came out and still not fixed, but just tossing out more and more DLC-s and more content. I love this game, i do. But god i hope Paradox somehow, magicallllyyy reads this, feels sorry for me because i had a really good gig going on, played tall, i was technologically lightyears away from everyone, i played small galaxy, playstyle TALL i had assload of habitats and nearly no planets. Few Ecumolopolies to feed me with alloys and that's it, i make a lovely amount of ships, get me fleet nice and buffed aaaand *gulp* my fps drops from 25 (which is actually in a way bearable) to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 10.... One day goes longer by than a second, game was literally still. Commanded my fleet to go few systems ahead towards enemy (around 250 days to get there) I did a cigarette, ♥♥♥♥, drank some coffe and when i got back, my fleet was 3/4 way. Sooooo i just rage quitted and now writing this lovely article. What makes matters worse is actually there are no mods to fix the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ issue. When game developers been a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LAZY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, moddders have always made ze game better is it by smol QOL mods or perfomance ones. But not even for Stellaris. Is this game reallllyyy running on so ♥♥♥♥ engine that not even modders can't do anything about it? ♥♥♥♥ wish i could get a refund on this game. ._. And people complain that Cyberspunk is badly optimized, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ flakies haven't tried stellaris lmao. Anyways, answer my question in ze comment section ""HOW CAN I BOOST STELLARIS PERFOMANCE STARTING YEAR 2400"" And i will delete this novel and i'll give it a thumbs up that it really should deserve. But until then, i won't touch this game.

6784,halfkillerrex,https://steamcommunity.com/id/halfkillerrex/,"I'm not the kind of gamer that dedicates thousands of hours to a single game. I usually play some hours of one game before switching off to another, and that's how it's pretty much always been. My top five games most played on Steam all have roughly 100-200 hours each after having them for several years. In that regard, Stellaris is so absolutely out of the ballpark. I've had this game pretty much since it came out, and let me tell you that I've spent almost as much time worldbuilding the empire that I wanted to put into action on its map as I have actually playing the game. It's incredible riches, both in its vanilla content as well as the glorious Workshop community surrounding this game, makes it one of the easiest games to sink hours upon hours into and revolutionises what it means for me to roleplay a civilisation. Though I do feel the vanilla game is short on shipsets, for instance, the modding community has made up for it spectacularly. Do I want to roleplay a species similar to the asari from Mass Effect? I have a shipset for that, and animated portraits to boot. Do I feel like playing as the Covenant from Halo and massacre the galaxy? There's mods for that too! Do I want to play as the Terminators and ravage the galaxy in a blaze of mechanical efficiency? All of this is possible, and with little bits and bops that makes each experience so unique, so magnificent, that I just have to keep coming back to it. The story behind your game -- the motivation of your people, the structure of your government, what the civil society would and wouldn't support... it's all in your hands. It gives a liberty to be creative that I haven't had the chance to experience in other games, and I think that's probably the main reason I'd recommend this game to people. Because the universe is yours to build in accordance to your vision, whatever that vision may be. If you don't play as the Reapers and harvest the galaxy at least once, though, you're playing it wrong.",Recommended,1624.0,487.0 hrs on record,Posted: 1 March

6850,76561198936823619,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198936823619/,"Great game. Even without mods Stellaris has near infinite replay ability, the Steam workshop support means you can do just about anything. Wanna make a sun go supernova? You can do it. Shove the entire galaxy's population on one little rock? Yep. Put a massive world ending cannon on a tiny ship? Nobody's stopping you. Some suggestions I have: -The ability to create and share mod playsets with friends. You can do it with mod lists in Steam but it can get time consuming. -A discount pack for the DLCs. The combined price of all DLCs is around $100, when you also account for the price of the game it is around $140. I understand the developer needs to make money but that seems unreasonable, maybe like an $80 ultimate edition or something would make people more willing to buy extra content. -I'd like the ability to switch mod playsets from the main menu, currently the only way (that I know of) to switch playsets is to close the game and open it again to get to the launcher. A ""Return to Launcher"" button would be good too. -More megastructures in the base game. Currently there is just one megastructure in the base game, its the sad Warp Gate. If you want anything else you can go pay like $20 for a DLC. For a $40 game I'd expect more content included, but in a way it seems like the developers want you to pay for every update. -Update the armies. Yes, I know it is a space game. But the armies seem like just an afterthought in Stellaris, you blow up all the ships in a system, take the station, and if you have time on your hands you can casually step on an empire's homeworld. It'd be nice if planets could put up more resistance to invasion fleets. Maybe shooting down transports and bombardment ships rather than the AI ignoring you. -Better automatic ship designs. It doesn't happen often, but occasionally the AI will use weapons and components that are considered obsolete or are just inferior to another component. Most often this happens with modded components. It would be much better if the AI compared the stats and also accounted for the ship's role in battle. I love Stellaris and it was well worth the money, most of my complaints aren't huge issues and I can only see this game getting better over time.",Recommended,1827.0,203.0 hrs on record,Posted: 26 February

There's always been one kicking around on my PC somewhere, with MOO2 of course looming large over that whole history.  Until Stellaris came along, that is. I'm reviewing this well into the game's history.  It's changed a lot since Day 1, probably more so than any Paradox game.  It's deep and wide - pretty much every system you can think of is modeled somewhere - from detailed ship design to fiddling around with empire-wide policies to gene tailoring your citizens and crafting robots.  This can be incredibly overwhelming, but the AI does a reasonable job on the bits you ignore. Stellaris is most differentiated when you realize it is just as much an RPG as it is a 4X game, with your empire as the main character and a ton of fun little stories that emerge as you go along, some of which are only in your head.  Want to be a bunch of political space vampires? Interstellar knights? Greedy corporatists? Depressed machine intelligences?  Sure, go right ahead! It adds a ton of fun to the game when you follow your own head-canon for your species/rulers and see what happens. What Stellaris doesn't fix (but does try to!) is the interminable mid and end game that is common to all 4X games.  At least for me, this is super grindy and I tend to have a lot of save files that never get re-opened in that stage.  Stellaris does have Big Universe Spanning Crises that can spice things up, and they seem to get more interesting as the game evolves, so keep that in mind. At the end of the day, if you are a 4X person and you don't have this game, I'm terribly surprised.  The barrier to entry is cost, because most if not all the DLCs are very cool, but you can start with the base game and get a really good feel how it works.",Recommended,1462.0,127.2 hrs on record,Posted: 25 February

It is extremely fun. The customization of your empire is extraordinary and it defies what kind of empire you are. It is also a very beautiful game and lots of unique stories in terms of archaeology, survey, anomalies, etc. The only 2 cons i have for this game is that a lot of content is locked away behind DLC. Like choosing how your empire started, this is called the origin story. And also a few species that bring their own benefit and uniqueness. The other con is the learning curve. Managing an economy, military, and at the same time expanding before your rivals is a challenge, and unfortunately there is little to no help at all.

I expected more accuracy in some main features of a huge effort like this, such as: - You can occasionally face fleets 10 times stronger than yours at early stage. It is a gap you cannot compensate even after 50 years. - The other empires take possession of many star systems in a matter of years apparently bypassing Influence amounts. This implies you making every effort to slow down a fast expansion on their side. - The diplomacy is only 'falsely' detailed. In fact, you sooner or later realize it tends to follow some precise lines, a kind of predestination that leaves little room to chance or randomness. You are somehow forced to play their way and not yours. - There is no point in making countless DLC's most people won't buy if the base game is partially compromised. After playing some less detailed but nicely balanced games such as the Endless Space series, I think the game is badly balanced in some key features.

From Psionics to Guided Evolution to becoming a civilization of Synths, or even starting out as a machine nexus, there is so much to do.

6970,tedddeux,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tedddeux/,"I think Stellaris is a pretty solid real-time space 4X in general, but what really sets it apart is the degree of control and detail you're given in creating your stellar civilizations and the opportunity to do your own storytelling as you play the game. For example, a big driver for my games is the Ethics wheel. On empire creation you can chose 2-3 minor or major ethics from a selection of 8 ethics in opposing pairs-- Authoritarian versus Egalitarian, Xenophile versus Xenophobe-- or you can exist outside those pairs as a Gestalt Consciousness of hive-minded swarms or neutral-linked automatons. These provide gameplay bonuses and limitations, but also inform how you might want to play the game. Is your empire made up of spiritualist xenophobes, smiting your repugnant neighbours when they offend your sensibilities or settle too close? Are you a pacifist materialist empire, where your robots are not just the backbone of your workforce but also full citizens? Might you be a singular consciousness in many bodies, inscrutable and distrusted by other species but internally stable? Or will you take that last choice to an extreme, as a genocidal force which intends to purge the galaxy of all consciousness which is not your own? Even beyond the ethics selections, once in-game an empire can set policies about their people, practices, and beliefs. Are the pre-sapient species on your planets kept as food, purged as pests, or possibly uplifted as a member species of your empire? Do you even tolerate species other than the founders of the empire? Does your trade policy emphasise the availability of consumer goods, the betterment of society, or pure wealth creation? There's a lot to be said about this game, and I encourage you to read a lot of reviews, I'm just highlighting what I think makes this game stand out: choices when building and running your empire acting as a launching pad for telling fun stories and informing your strategic choices. I also don't want to make it sound so complex that it's intimidating. You can choose one of the premade empires for your first go-around, and can play a full game without changing any of your policies from the default, then once you're more comfortable it's another layer to optimize your playstyle or to refine your empire's philosophies. If there's a downside, other than how long a single game can last, it's how many of the great features are not available in the base game. The developer has continued expanding and adding gameplay elements over time as a combination of FreeLC and DLC, so you'll read a cool story about an endgame event only to find out that you'll never see it unless you bought the Leviathans DLC. My advice? Buy the base game (or some kind of pack if it's on sale) and see if you like it. If yes, and if you're anything like me, you're going to gradually buy almost all the extra content as it comes up on sale... or as they come out if you're impatient, because as of this writing the game is still being actively updated with content packs. So, anyway, that's a recommend.",Recommended,2536.0,418.2 hrs on record,Posted: 21 February

6988,76561197971988439,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971988439/,"Edit: Alright, going to begrudgingly change this one to a thumbs up. It's an enjoyable game, but there is an unforgiving learning curve in the way of mechanics that are easily avoidable once you know to avoid them. I dislike that kind of game system myself as it merely punishes new players without actually being a challenge. There are several mechanics that I list below which I hate, but you can set your game up to avoid these things once you're aware of them. Except for giving your enemies open borders upon winning a war against them, that one cannot be avoided and doesn't even really make sense. If you engage in war with someone, afterwards you will have ten years of open borders with them. Just worth noting. There's several arbitrary rules like that which in my opinion should be something that can be altered via Policies in game. This is a hard one for me because I enjoy the concept of the game, but it's just too frustrating to play through. The developers want you to play this sandbox game a fairly specific way. It's geared towards diplomacy and making friends. It makes playing a game like this in the ""traditional"" way just plain annoying. I prefer not to try to balance AI ""friendships"" that act very strange and ask for a NAP one day then break it then ask for it again then break it etc etc. The AI is far from perfect, so I don't really feel inclined to play Diplomat with some janky AI. I just had a very successful war, completed all of my war goals and took half of this AIs territory. It's now ranked as ""Pathetic"" compared to me. The fun part is that, for absolutely no legitimate reason winning a war forces me to have open borders with that AI for a certain amount of years. Long enough to allow them to skirt past my front lines and start settling systems that I'd previously had blocked off. I'm just left sitting here like, what's the point? No matter how well I play the game, the devs don't want me to be a war monger. They want me to play Diplomat with some janky AI and they punish me for not playing the game the way they want me to play it by introducing arbitrary mechanics that don't make sense. I was just at war with these people, why would I be letting them in my backyard to sabotage my empire? I wouldn't. I'd love to see some real world examples of this happening, you know, like just even one example from history where a conquering nation just opens there doors to the enemy and allows them to wander around unchecked. I'm fairly certain it's actually never happened, because it's idiotic and reeks of feel good naive nonsense that permeates our culture these days. Do not buy Stellaris if you want Civilization in space. It's not that. It's space diplomacy, there's ""war"" in it, kind of. But it's not ""war"", it's some variety of conflict that's very controlled and limited. Every single playthrough I've had leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I spent hours and hours and hours making sure my border was protected, and then because I overwhelmingly crushed an opponent all that hard work goes out the door, for reasons that make absolutely no sense? All because Paradox I guess wants us all to hold hands and sing songs and be friendly. Open your borders to your enemy, guy! --Tried another play through. Did exceptionally well, in so far as I was absolutely whipping the AI. The closest AI to me was ""Inferior"" on all counts and the rest were all  ranked ""Pathetic"". I had managed to steal a Ringworld, and build a Dyson sphere. At some point or another I guess I researched something called Sapient AIs, which is apparently a ""dangerous technology"" and just now I had a ""Robotic Uprising"" that took over my homeworld, Ringworld, most of my Shipyards, and spawned in with more Fleet strength than I had ( which was several times more than all other AI ). So basically I just lost the game, to myself, because I researched something that I shouldn't have and there was no real warning. I asked in the Discord how something like this can happen and was told that there was plenty of warnings-- there was not. I wasn't busy with a war, I was literally passing time and getting research done. I wasn't ignoring pop ups, there was no AI events. All of a sudden I lost most of my important star systems and was up against a larger army, while not having any star ports to recruit more Fleets. This is in a what, eight or nine hour game. I basically just got one shot KO'd. There was nothing I could do, the developers basically jebait you with a Technology that is set up to destroy your entire playthrough.",Recommended,3717.0,100.0 hrs on record,Posted: 21 February

If you want to declare war on someone you have to go through a whole claiming process. That is fine but when it actually comes to war, the game forces you to have to invade and ultimately deal with a metric ton of micromanagement that it entails. If you wanted to play as a Xenophobe and simply bombard your opponents planets to oblivion because: 1) they aren't very good 2) their biome doesn't match your preferred biome for your race and 3) you don't want to deal with micromanaging your entire empire for the next few hours because of crime, instability, migration (yes buildings you spent ages aquiring will instantly be ruined because a large number of your pop now decides to instantly visit these newly conquered planets) Then you are fresh out of luck. Bombarding takes years in game and I haven't actually seen it reduce population, just devastate the planet i.e. put a neg modifier on it. Before all the fan boys start yelling, yes I had it set to indiscriminate, and yes I was xenophobe, and no I don't want to make the opponent a vassal, I want to annihilate them. I actually was half way to full war weariness just to try bomb one planet. The game isn't deep or complex, just unnecessarily convoluted and micromanagement Hell. The only real enjoyable aspect is the music, some nice visuals (although it is so lazy for Paradox to just use popup windows for everything with static, uninspiring pictures) and searching new systems and planets to get the stories behind those. This is really just a few aspects that annoy me, but there are plenty. I'm sure these are overcome with some DLC though, which Paradox is renowned for doing. Sorry but if your base game is too poorly designed at the outset, there is no way I am giving you more money for DLC. In short, avoid and get a space strategy game that is actually fun to play. This had the potential to be a really good game, with some interesting concepts behind it, but not with how it currently operates.
